A party electing arbitration shall initiate it through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, in person, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) any in person arbitration will take place in the county in which the city or town you have entered as your residence sits (and if neither is applicable, then the arbitration shall take place in San Francisco County, California); (c) either party may bring a claim in small claims court in lieu of arbitration; (d) the ADR provider may award any form of individual relief; (e) UBISOFT will pay all costs for non-frivolous claims; (f) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction; (g) UBISOFT may not seek reimbursement of its attorney's fees in connection with such arbitration; (h) in the event you receive an arbitration award greater than UBISOFT's last written settlement offer, UBISOFT will pay a ten thousand U.S. Dollar ($10,000.00 USD) minimum recovery and twice the amount of your attorney's fees, (i) claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You hereby agree that for any dispute or claim that is less than $10,000 USD, you waive any right to a trial (by judge or jury), you waive any right to participate as a member of a class in a class action or similar proceeding, and you will abide by the dispute resolution mechanism in this Section.

10.4.3 For any dispute that is equal to or more than $10,000 and is not resolved or arbitrated under Section 10.4.2 of this EULA, it is hereby agreed that any action at law or in equity arising under this EULA shall be finally adjudicated or determined in any court or courts of the State of California, or of the United States of America, in Los Angeles County, California and the parties hereto hereby submit generally and unconditionally to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts in respect to any such matter and consent to service of process by any means authorized by California law.

10.4.4 All claims you bring against UBISOFT must be resolved in accordance with this Section 10. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of this EULA. Should either party file a claim contrary to this Section, the other party may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to ten thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00USD), provided that such party seeking such fees has notified the other in writing of the improperly filed claim, and the other has failed to promptly withdraw the claim.

5.1 The Software components which are validly licensed by End User and paid for to Reseller (or Awingu, as the case may be) can be installed and used for such amount (number of Concurrent Users, capacity, or other parameter(s)) set forth in the Order Form. End User agrees to obtain additional Licenses for the Software before it exceeds, or is likely to exceed, any of the limitations applicable to End User’s License.

5.2 Each Concurrent User may access an unlimited number of applications or programs through the Software, provided however that the number of concurrent tabs that are simultaneously opened in one browser shall be limited to five (5).

5.3 End User expressly acknowledges and agrees that only End User, and not Reseller nor Awingu, is responsible for verifying whether the applicable laws and regulations of the country where End User intends to install and use the Software and Documentation, allows the installation and/or use of the Software and Documentation, and for obtaining all necessary permits, licenses and authorisations required to be able to so install and use the Software and Documentation. End User will at all times comply with any and all applicable laws and regulations, including federal, state, local and international laws (“Applicable Law”) which may apply to the Software and Documentation and the installation and use thereof by End User.

6. THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE
6.1 End User expressly acknowledges that operation of the Software requires that End User has or obtains, at End User’s sole cost and expense, appropriate hardware and third-party software and/or application licenses, such as (but not limited to) operating systems. Except as expressly stated in Section 6.2, this EULA does not grant any license in or to any other software than the Software, and End User is responsible for procuring all such necessary third-party software or other hardware or equipment.

6.2 Awingu has integrated directly in the Software certain software supplied by third parties. Awingu provides access to such third-party software as part of the licensed Software. End User acknowledges and agrees that such third-party software is subject to various other terms and conditions imposed by the licensors of such third-party software. As a result thereof, new license keys may possibly need to be activated in respect of Perpetual Licenses from time to time, without additional costs for the End User. A list of third-party software licenses, and the applicable terms thereof, shall be provided with the Software. Such third-party software is provided “AS IS”, with no warranties of any kind. Any third-party software sublicense will terminate when this EULA terminates or when the Software is no longer being used by the End User. End User’s use of such third-party software is subject to, and governed by, the specified third-party license terms, except that this Section 6.2 (Third-Party Software) and Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) of this EULA also govern End User’s use of the third-party software. End User acknowledges that all third-party licensors and suppliers in respect of the Software retain all rights, title and interest in their respective software products. End User agrees to comply with such third-party license terms.

 
7. LICENSE FEES
7.1 General. End User understands and agrees that, if and to the extent the use of the Software is made available as a result of End User’s business relationship with Reseller, End User shall pay Reseller the License Fees and any other amounts owing for the use of the Software (including, but not limited to, related Maintenance and Support Fees), as the case may be, plus any applicable sales, use, excise, or other taxes, as specified by the Reseller’s terms and conditions of sales. When purchasing the licensed rights directly from Awingu, the End User shall pay the aforementioned fees and amounts directly to Awingu.

All fees payable to Reseller and/or Awingu, as the case may be, are due and payable pursuant to the terms stipulated in the Order Form. Failure to pay the License Fees and/or other amounts owing for the use of the Software (plus any applicable taxes) may result in termination of the License and related Maintenance and Support Services.

7.2 Payments for Subscription Licenses. If licensed under a Subscription License, End User agrees to pay the initial, and, thereafter, the recurring fees for the Subscription License (the “Subscription License Fees”) as described in the original Order Form and based upon the rates and amounts set forth in the original Order Form (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 7.4).

Maintenance and Support Fees are included in the Subscription License Fees. End User also agrees to pay any other fees or charges listed on an Order Form for additional professional services or other services (collectively, the “Other Fees”) separately and upfront, in addition to the Subscription License Fees.

7.3 Payments for Perpetual Licenses. If licensed under a Perpetual License, End User agrees to pay upfront the one-off fees for the Perpetual License (the “Perpetual License Fees”) as described in the original Order Form and based upon the rates and amounts set forth in the original Order Form (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 7.4).

Maintenance and Support Fees are not included in the Perpetual License Fees. End User agrees to pay the Maintenance and Support Fees and Other Fees set forth in the Order Form separately and upfront, including, in any event, the Maintenance and Support Fees relating to the Initial Maintenance Period of a Subscription License, which is mandatory to the End User under such License (see Section 8.3).

To the extent End User takes delivery of additional licenses (i.e. in the event End User wishes to increase the number of Concurrent Users) the pricing shall be subject to the pricing stipulated in the original Order Form, unless such pricing is amended pursuant to Section 7.4 (in which case such amended pricing shall be applied), and the Maintenance and Support Fees relating to such additional licenses shall be prorated over the balance of the then-current Initial or Subsequent Maintenance Period.

7.4 Price Amendments. Reseller may amend the Subscription License Fees and/or the Other Fees, provided that such revised or amended Fees shall only become applicable after the termination of the then current license or maintenance term (i.e. the revised or amended License Fees shall apply to the Subsequent License Term or Subsequent Maintenance Period only). Any additional licenses bought by End User shall be provided at the then current License Fees (as may be amended from time to time).

7.5 Reseller payments. If and to the extent the use of the Software is made available as a result of End User’s business relationship with Reseller, Awingu acknowledges that End User shall pay all fees under this EULA directly to Reseller and hereby consents to that arrangement.

 
8. MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES
8.1 General. Subject to (i) the payment of the relevant Maintenance and Support Fees by End User, and (ii) the use by such End User of Version N or Version N-1 of the Software as referred to in Section 8.6 hereinafter, Reseller shall provide End User with Maintenance and Support Services, to the extent directly relating to the Software, in accordance with the provisions set forth hereinafter. However, when purchasing the licensed rights directly from Awingu, the End User shall receive Maintenance and Support Services directly from Awingu.

8.2 Subscription License. Each Subscription License shall include the right to receive Maintenance and Support Services. Maintenance and Support Services may not be separated from the Subscription License and may not be terminated without also terminating the Subscription License.

8.3 Perpetual License. With respect to the Perpetual Licenses, End User shall subscribe separately to the Maintenance and Support Services on an annual basis. End User hereby purchases Maintenance and Support Services at the price set forth in the Order Form for a term as indicated in the Order Form, including at least the first year as from the Delivery Date (the “Initial Maintenance Period”), during which term the Maintenance and Support Services are mandatory under Perpetual Licenses. The Initial Maintenance Period may be extended to three (3) years if so provided in the Order Form. Upon expiration of the Initial

Maintenance Period, End User’s subscription to the Maintenance and Support Services relating to Perpetual Licenses shall be automatically renewed at Reseller’s then current rates for subsequent terms of the same duration (i.e. one year each or three years each) (the “Subsequent Maintenance Periods”), unless explicitly terminated by either the Reseller or the End User at the end of the Initial Maintenance Period or at the end of any Subsequent Maintenance Period upon giving a three (3) months prior written notice by registered mail to the terminated party (either Awingu or End User), starting the first day of the month following the date of delivery of such termination notice. The aforementioned termination rights are without prejudice to the specific termination rights set forth under subsequent Section 8.4.

8.4 Price Amendments. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of any Maintenance Period, Reseller or Awingu (as the case may be) may provide notice to End User of the amended Maintenance and Support Fees for the upcoming Maintenance Period. Thereafter, with respect to all Concurrent Users under license, End User may elect to (i) renew Maintenance and Support Services at the amended fee rates, or (ii) elect not to renew Maintenance and Support Services. If no written notice is provided to Reseller or Awingu, as the case may be, prior to the expiration of any Maintenance Period, there shall be an automatic renewal of Maintenance and Support Services at Reseller’s or Awingu’s revised Maintenance and Support Fees.

8.5 Software Maintenance. Subject to the payment of the relevant Maintenance and Support Fees, Awingu shall provide End User, from time to time, with Updates (including periodic distribution of bug fixes, maintenance releases and minor enhancements) as scheduled by Awingu in its sole discretion. End User may refuse to accept an Update.

The Maintenance and Support Services shall be exclusive of any Upgrades to the Software. In order for End User to receive and use such Upgrade, End User must (i) pay the applicable License Fees for that Upgrade; (ii) to the extent not included in such applicable License Fees, pay the applicable Maintenance and Support Fees for the then current Maintenance Period. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the terms of this EULA shall apply and the Upgrade shall be deemed Licensed Software upon payment by End User of the applicable License Fees.

8.6 Support Services. Upon each new release (regardless whether such release constitutes an Upgrade or an Update), Awingu shall maintain only the Version of the Product that has been thus revised

(hereinafter: “Version N”) and the previous Version (hereinafter “Version N-1”). End User shall be eligible for such Maintenance and Support Services only if and to the extent (i) End User has duly paid the applicable Maintenance and Support Fees; and (ii) End User is using Version N and/or Version N-1 of the Software.

8.7 End of support notice. End User shall receive an “end of support” notice not later than eight (8) days prior to the effective date at which the Software is updated to Version N-1 or Version N, informing End User that as from such date, the version preceding Version N-1 shall no longer be supported, thus terminating such End User’s right to Support and Maintenance Services. End User shall not be entitled to any refunds of Maintenance and Support Fees.

8.8 Response to Inquiries. Subject to End User’s payment of the applicable Maintenance and Support

Fees, (i) End User’s installation support inquiries by telephone will be accepted by Reseller (or Awingu, as the case may be) during normal business hours; and (ii) End User’s technical support email inquiries are accepted at any time and will be answered during normal business hours. Reseller (or Awingu, as the case may be) will attempt to respond to inquiries within the same business day.

 
9. WARRANTIES
9.1 Software Warranty. Awingu warrants that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the applicable part of the Documentation for a period of sixty (60) days following the date on which the Software is delivered to End User or otherwise made available to End User for download (the “Warranty Period“) when maintained and operated in accordance with the License and the Documentation (“Software Warranty”).

THE SOFTWARE WARRANTY WILL NOT APPLY IF ANY FAILURE, ERROR, DEFECT OR MALFUNCTION RESULTS FROM ANY MISUSE OF THE SOFTWARE OR IS OTHERWISE NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO AWINGU. AWINGU MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY (I) THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET END USER’S REQUIREMENTS, (II) THAT ALL ERRORS, DEFECTS, OR MALFUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN OR CAN BE ELIMINATED FROM THE SOFTWARE, (III) THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE OF ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES OR MALFUNCTIONS, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, OR (IV) THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE WITH OTHER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS OR DATA, AND RESELLER SHALL IN NO EVENT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LIABILITY FOR BUSINESS EXPENSE, MACHINE DOWNTIME, LOSS OF OR CORRUPTION TO DATA, OR DAMAGES CAUSED TO END USER OR THIRD PARTIES BY ANY DEFICIENCY, DEFECT, ERROR OR MALFUNCTION. THE SOFTWARE WARRANTY APPLIES ONLY TO THE ORIGINAL END USER AND IS NOT TRANSFERABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY OR ASSIGNEE OF END USER.

If End User fails to pay when due any payment required from End User to Reseller or Awingu under this EULA or otherwise, the Software Warranty and the related remedies of End User will automatically become null and void and of no further force or effect.

End User must notify Awingu by email or through other contact mechanisms provided by Awingu of any breach of the Software Warranty within the Warranty Period.

9.2 Remedies. Subject to the limitations set forth in the subsequent Section 10 entitled “Limitation of Liability”, End User’s exclusive remedy, and Awingu’s entire liability, arising from any breach of the Software Warranty shall be, at Awingu’s option and at no cost to End User, for Awingu to (i) make commercially reasonable efforts to correct or provide a reasonable Workaround for the failure, error, defect or malfunction that caused the breach of the Software Warranty, or (ii) replace the (defective part of the) Software. If any breach of Software Warranty claim by End User falls within any of the exceptions listed above in the first paragraph of the present Section “Warranties”, End User shall upon Awingu’s request pay Awingu for such assistance and services provided by Awingu in respect thereof on a time and material basis at Awingu’s then current professional services rates and related expenses.

9.3 Disclaimer. THE SOFTWARE WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, AWINGU EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. USE OF THE SOFTWARE BY END USER IS AT END USER’S SOLE RISK.

 
10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
10.1 Exclusion of indirect damages. In no event shall Awingu be liable to End User or any third party under any theory of liability for lost profits and/or any other indirect, incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages, however caused, including, without limitation, (i) loss of revenue, business or use; (ii) loss of anticipated savings; (iii) loss of actual or anticipated business and/or goods; (iv) loss of goodwill; (v) loss and/or corruption of data and/or other information, (vi) loss as a result of third party claims; and/or (vii) the cost of procuring replacement goods and/or services. For the avoidance of doubt, the types of loss and/or damage specified in (i) through (vii) shall not constitute direct losses for the purposes of this EULA. The foregoing limitation will apply even if Awingu has been advised of the possibility of such damages or if such damages are foreseeable.

10.2 Cap on other damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this EULA, and to the fullest extent allowed under Applicable Law, Awingu’s aggregate liability of all kinds towards End User for any damages arising from or related to the Software, the Documentation or this EULA, other than as set out under 10.1 above, whether for breach, infringement, in tort, indemnification or otherwise, shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to either (i) the license fees in respect of the Software only (excl. any taxes) actually received by Reseller or Awingu for End User’s use of the Software during the six (6) month period preceding End User’s initial notice to Awingu of any claim or potential claim hereunder; or (ii) 50,000 EUR, whichever amount is lower. The existence of one or more claims under this EULA shall not enlarge the limit.

10.3 No limitations for Awingu’s own intent. The aforementioned limitations and exclusions will not apply in the event the liability results from Awingu’s proven willful intent (opzet) or gross negligence (zware fout), or that of its subordinates or assistants.

10.4 Employees and agents. The limitations and exclusions of liability, as well as indemnity stipulated for Awingu itself in the present EULA are also stipulated for and on behalf of Awingu’s directors, employees, agents and other intermediaries and/or any other person employed by it or delivering services to it within the framework of the EULA.

10.5 Limitation in time. End User may not bring a claim under this EULA more than twelve (12) months after the cause of action arises.

 
11. IP INFRINGEMENTS
In the event of a claim that the Software and/or Documentation, or End User’s permitted use thereof under this EULA, infringes a third party’s intellectual property, proprietary or other right, or Awingu’s belief that

such claim is likely to arise, Awingu shall have the right, at its sole option and expense: to (a) procure for End User the right to continue using the affected Software and/or Documentation; (b) replace or modify the affected (part of the) Software and/or Documentation so that it does not infringe; or (c) terminate this EULA. If Awingu so terminates this EULA, as End User’s sole remedy and Awingu’s entire liability, Awingu will pay to End User, upon End User’s certified deletion of the affected Software, an amount equal to the License Fees paid hereunder for the License in respect of the affected Software, prorated from the Delivery Date, based on a straight line depreciation, through the date the License is terminated over the original term of the License.

 
12. TERM AND TERMINATION
12.1 Term. The term of this EULA shall commence on the Delivery Date, and will remain effective during:

the Initial License Term and Subsequent License Term (in case of a Subscription License), it being understood that a Subscription License shall be automatically renewed at the end of the Initial License Term or each Subsequent License Term, each time for a Subsequent License Term, unless explicitly terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12; or
for an indefinite term (in case of a Perpetual License), except if terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of this Section
12. 2 Termination upon notice. A Subscription License can be terminated at the end of the relevant Initial License Term or at any time during a Subsequent License Term upon giving a two (2) months prior written notice by registered mail to Awingu (or, if terminated by Awingu, to the relevant End User), starting on the first day of the month following the date of delivery of such termination notice.

12.3 Termination for Cause. Without prejudice to either party’s other rights accorded to it by this EULA (especially the termination rights under Section 2.2) or by law, either party can terminate this EULA with immediate effect by written notice to the other party, if any of the following events occur: (i) the other party breaches this EULA and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of the receipt of written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party; (ii) the other party breaches this EULA, and such breach is not curable (a breach of the License terms by End User shall be deemed a breach which is not curable); (iii) the other party makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, files a voluntary petition of bankruptcy, becomes subject to any proceedings under any bankruptcy or insolvency law (whether domestic or foreign), has wound up or liquidated, voluntarily or otherwise; (iv) the other party becomes insolvent or ceases or threatens to cease to carry on its business in the normal course; (v) the other party suffers or permits the appointment of a receiver for its business or assets; or (vi) any other event analogous to those listed under (iii) through (v) occurs in the jurisdiction applicable to the party affected. The affected party shall promptly notify the other party in the event of the occurrence of any of the foregoing instances as per (iii) through (v). Termination by either Party pursuant to this Section 12.23 shall not entitle the other Party to any refund of any prepaid License Fees or Other Fees.

12.4 Effect of Termination. If the term of this EULA expires or is terminated for any reason whatsoever, the License shall automatically terminate as set forth above and End User shall: (i) immediately cease using the Software and the Documentation; (ii) have an End User senior officer certify to Reseller within thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination that End User has permanently deleted, destroyed, or, at Awingu’s option, has returned to Awingu the Documentation and all copies thereof. Neither party shall be liable to the other for damages of any kind solely as a result of terminating this EULA in accordance with this section 12. Either party’s termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to any other right or remedy that it may have at law or in equity, and shall not relieve either party of breaches occurring prior to the effective date of such termination.

 
13. VERIFICATION
13.1 During the term of this EULA and for a period of three (3) years from the expiration or termination thereof, End User shall maintain accurate records of its use of the Software sufficient to demonstrate its compliance with the terms of this EULA and all Order Forms.

13.2 Upon ten (10) days’ notice to End User, Awingu and/or Reseller shall have the right to (or to have a third party) inspect and audit such End User’s records and its systems to confirm End User’s compliance with the provisions of this EULA. End User agrees to fully cooperate with any such inspection and audit and shall provide all access to such records and its systems as reasonable required for Awingu and/or Reseller to confirm End User’s compliance with the terms hereof.

13.3 In the event that the audit reveals unauthorized use of the Software, or use beyond the scope of the usage limitations and restrictions applicable to the Software, then, without prejudice to Awingu’s other rights (including termination of the License), End User shall promptly pay the relevant License Fees (i.e. either the Subscription License Fees in case End User uses Subscription Licenses, or Perpetual License Fees in case End User uses Perpetual Licenses) and, in case of a Perpetual License, the Maintenance and Support Fees relating to the Initial Maintenance Period, in order to cover all use of the Software disclosed by the audit starting from the date the unlicensed use was presumed to have begun, plus a reinstatement fee of fifty percent (50%) of the applicable License Fees payable for such unlicensed use. End User agrees that all unlicensed use of the Software shall be presumed to have started on the first day on which the Software was made available to End User (through key download, delivery or otherwise), unless End User proves otherwise to the satisfaction of Awingu.

If the audit determines that End User underpaid the License Fees by more than five percent (5%), End User shall pay Awingu’s reasonable costs and expenses for the audit (including transportation, travel, and if applicable the cost of the third party auditor).

13.4 This Section 13 shall survive the termination of this EULA for any reason, and shall stay effective until three (3) years after the termination of this EULA.

 
14. CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS
14.1 End User agrees to keep the Confidential Information of Awingu confidential and not to disclose it to third parties, unless expressly otherwise agreed by a duly authorized representative of Awingu. End User shall be entitled to disclose Awingu’s Confidential Information only to those of its personnel, consultants and agents that have a reasonable need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of this EULA, and provided the End User instructs its personnel, consultants and agents to keep such information confidential by using the same care and discretion that it uses for its own Confidential Information and in no event, less than a reasonable degree of care.

14.2 The obligations set forth in this Section 14 shall not apply to any information which: (i) is published or otherwise becomes available to the general public through no fault of End User; (ii) has been validly obtained by End User from a third party not being bound by any confidentiality or similar secrecy obligation; (iii) was in End User’s possession without proprietary restrictions prior to the date of disclosure by Awingu and/or Reseller to End User; (iv) was developed by End User without reference to the Confidential Information; or (v) is required to be disclosed pursuant to Applicable Law, to the extent of such requirement only and provided that End User shall, if feasible, give to Reseller and/or Awingu prior notice of such proposed disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure.

14.3 This Section 14 shall survive the termination of this EULA for any reason, and shall stay effective until three (3) years after the termination of this EULA.

 
15. PRIVACY AND DATA COLLECTION
Awingu’s privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) sets forth how Awingu collects, uses, and protects any personal data which End User may provide to it. A copy of the Privacy Policy is available at www.awingu.com/privacy, which is incorporated herein by reference and forms an essential part of this EULA.

 
16. MISCELLANEOUS TERMS
16.1 Export and Government Restrictions. End User may not export or re-export the Software in violation of any applicable laws or regulations including but not limited to those of the United States of America and the European Union. In addition, if the Software is identified as export controlled items under the export laws of the United States of America or the European Union, End User represents and warrants that he/she is not a citizen, or otherwise located within, an embargoed nation and that he/she is not otherwise prohibited under applicable export laws from receiving the Software. Moreover if End User’s acquisition of the Software is subject to the laws of the United States of America, End User represents and warrants that he/she will comply with any specific restrictions and regulations that might be applicable to all contracts or agreements (including but not limited to the reproduction of the “restricted rights” proprietary notices and/or legends) concluded with the United States government or its agents and representatives. All rights to use the Software are granted on the condition that those rights are forfeited if End User fail to comply with the terms of this EULA.

16.2 Assignment. This EULA may not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by End User, by merger, acquisition, change of control, operation of law or otherwise, without the express prior written authorization from Awingu, which may withhold consent in its sole discretion. Any attempt by End User to assign, delegate or otherwise transfer this EULA in violation of the foregoing restrictions shall be a breach and Awingu shall have the right, in addition to any other remedy available at law or in equity, to terminate this EULA at any time subsequent to such breach.

Entire Agreement
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Huawei governing your use of the Software and supersedes any prior agreements between you and Huawei relating to the use of the Software. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase open source software, third-party content, or other Huawei services.

This End User License Agreement (“EULA”) is between the individual consumer or business entity that will use the Software (“You”) and the applicable entity identified in the “Licensor Table” located at www.dell.com/swlicensortable (“Licensor”).

This EULA governs Your use of: (a) the object code version of Dell branded software that is preinstalled on Dell hardware or otherwise provided to You pursuant to a purchase contract, quote, order form, invoice or online procurement process (each, an “Order”); (b) associated software license keys, if any (“License Keys”);
(c) updates to such software (“Updates”); (d) the documentation for such software; and (e) all copies of the foregoing (collectively, “Software”). If You accept this EULA, or if You install or use the Software, then You agree to this EULA unless You already have a signed agreement with Dell Marketing L.P. or one of its affiliates (“Dell”) that includes licensing terms that govern Your use of the Software (“Pre-Existing Agreement”). If You accept this EULA or install or use the Software on behalf of a business entity, then You represent that You have authority to take those actions, and this EULA will be binding on that business entity unless the entity already has a Pre-Existing Agreement. If You do not agree to this EULA, do not install or use the Software.

If You are a business entity and You purchase Software from a third party (“Reseller”) who sublicenses the Software to You under the terms of an agreement between You and such Reseller (a “Sublicense Agreement”), then the terms of Your Sublicense Agreement with the Reseller shall govern Your use of the Software and not this EULA. Resellers may only grant rights, and must pass through conditions, consistent with this EULA. Thus, even though Your Sublicense Agreement is between you and the Reseller, by installing or using the Software, You acknowledge and agree that: (a) any license rights in the Sublicense Agreement that are greater than the license rights in this EULA shall not apply; (b) any license conditions in this EULA that are not contained in the Sublicense Agreement apply to You; (c) the limitations of liability set forth in this EULA will apply in favor of Licensor, its affiliates and suppliers despite the existence of a Sublicense Agreement; and (d) Licensor is a third-party beneficiary of the Sublicense Agreement and is entitled to exercise and enforce all of the Reseller’s rights and benefits under that Sublicense Agreement.

If You purchase Software as an individual consumer, nothing in this EULA affects your statutory rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.

If You are an individual consumer, You may transfer the Software on a permanent basis as part of the sale or transfer of the hardware system on which the Software is loaded, provided that You retain no copies of any version of the Software. If You are a business entity, You may not transfer the Software to another person or entity without the express written permission of Dell, unless allowed by applicable law stating that transfer may not be restricted (note that a transfer fee may be charged by Dell).

4. Compliance Verification. If You are a business entity, You must: (a) maintain and use systems and procedures that allow You to accurately track Your use of the Software; (b) certify to Dell in writing, at Dell’s request, that Your use of Software fully complies with this EULA, indicating the number of Software licenses deployed at that time; and (c) cooperate fully and timely with Dell and its auditors if Dell notifies You that it will conduct an audit to confirm Your compliance with this EULA. Any such audit will be conducted during normal business hours. If Dell determines that You have over-deployed Software, You agree to immediately purchase licenses at the then-current list price to bring Your use into compliance. If You over-deployed Software by 5% or more, then You agree to pay the total cost of the audit, in addition to any other liabilities You may have.

5. Third Party Software. “Third Party Software” is software, including open source software, that is contained in or provided with the Software and is licensed by a third party under its own terms of use (“Third Party Terms”). Third Party Software is governed solely by the applicable Third Party Terms and not by this EULA. Third Party Terms may be provided with the Third Party Software or may be included in the OST Table. For certain open source software, the applicable Third Party Terms may entitle You to obtain the corresponding source files. You may find corresponding source files for such open source software at //opensource.dell.com/ or in the “About” or “Read Me” file of Software, or other locations that Licensor may specify.

6. Free Software. “Free Software” means Software that is provided to You without additional charge (e.g., scripts that enable customer installation; code that enables You to monitor Your use of Dell products; etc.).  You may only use Free Software on or with equipment or in the operating environments for which Dell has designed that Free Software to operate. Licensor may terminate any license to Free Software at any time in its sole discretion. You may not transfer Free Software to anyone else.

7. Development Tools. If the Software includes development tools, such as scripting tools, APIs or sample scripts (collectively “Development Tools”), and unless there is a separate agreement between You and Dell or Licensor for the Development Tools, You may use such Development Tools to create new scripts and code for the purpose of customizing Your use of the Software (within the parameters set forth in this EULA and in the Development Tools themselves) and for no other purpose.

8. Evaluation Software. This EULA does not license use of Software for evaluation purposes (“Evaluation Software”) except to the extent these terms may be invoked by the separate license terms and conditions accompanying that Evaluation Software.

9. Support Services Not Included. If You purchase maintenance and support for Software, such services are identified in Your Order and will be provided under a separate services agreement.

10. Termination. For Subscription Software, this EULA automatically terminates at the end of Your subscription period unless You renew Your rights. Licensor may terminate this EULA if You or a Permitted Third Party commits a material breach of this EULA and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days following Your receipt of notice of the breach from Dell. This right to terminate applies accordingly if Dell or the Reseller from whom You made Your purchase does not receive timely payment for the licenses to the Software or for the hardware on which the Software is loaded, if any. When this EULA terminates, all licenses granted automatically terminate and You must immediately cease use of the Software and return or destroy all copies of the Software. Except as otherwise agreed by Dell, You will not get a refund from Dell if this EULA is terminated. Rights and obligations under Sections of this EULA that, by their nature should survive, will survive termination, as well as obligations for payment.

11. Warranty Disclaimer. Under this EULA, Licensor provides neither any warranties for the Software nor does it provide support for the Software. Your rights under any warranties and any support entitlements for Software acquired for a fee are solely between You and the Reseller or Dell entity from whom You procured the Software and related support, and are defined under the commercial terms agreed between You and such selling entity. Accordingly, except as otherwise offered by Dell, the Software is provided by Licensor under this EULA “As Is” without any warranties or conditions. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Licensor, on behalf of itself and its affiliates and suppliers: (a) makes no express warranties or conditions related to the Software; (b) disclaims all implied warranties and conditions related to the Software, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement; and (c) disclaims any warranty or condition arising by statute, operation of law, course of dealing or performance, or usage of trade. Licensor does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Software. This Section does not affect or modify any of the statutory warranty rights that are available to consumers.

12. Limitation of Liability.

12.1. Limitations on Damages. The limitations, exclusions and disclaimers set forth in a Pre-Existing Agreement or Dell Terms of Sale that applies your Order (in each case, the “Order Terms”) shall apply to all disputes, claims or controversies (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) between You and Licensor or Dell related to or arising out of: (a) this EULA; (b) the breach, termination or validity of this EULA; or (c) any Orders (each, a “Dispute”). In the absence of applicable Order Terms, the terms set forth in this Section shall apply to all Disputes.
 
The terms of this Section are agreed allocations of risk constituting part of the consideration for Licensor’s licensing of Software to You and will apply even if there is a failure of the essential purpose of any limited remedy, and regardless of whether a party has been advised of the possibility of the liabilities. If applicable law prohibits any portion of the limits on liability stated below, the parties agree that such limitation will be automatically modified, but only to the extent required to make the limitation compliant with applicable law.

A. Limitation on Direct Damages. Except for Your obligation to pay for the Software, or for Your violation of the License Grant and License Conditions set forth herein or of Licensor’s or Dell’s intellectual property rights, the total liability of You and Licensor (including Licensor’s affiliates and suppliers) arising out of any Dispute is limited to the amount You paid for the Software that is the subject of the Dispute, but excluding amounts received as reimbursement of expenses or payment of taxes. Notwithstanding anything otherwise set forth above, Licensor and its affiliates have no liability for any direct damages resulting from Your use or attempted use of Third Party Software, Free Software or Development Tools.

B. Disclaimer of Certain Other Damages. Except for Your obligation to pay for the Software, or for Your violation of the License Grant and License Conditions set forth herein or of Licensor’s or Dell’s intellectual property rights, neither You nor Licensor (including Licensor’s affiliates and suppliers) shall have any liability under this EULA for special, consequential, exemplary, punitive, incidental or indirect damages, or for lost profits, loss of revenue, loss or corruption of data, loss of use or procurement of substitute products or services.

12.2. Regular Backups. You are solely responsible for Your data. You must back up Your data before Licensor or a third party performs any remedial, upgrade or other work on Your production systems. You acknowledge that it is a best practice to have more than one back up copy of Your data. If applicable law prohibits exclusion of liability for lost data, then Licensor will only be liable for the cost of the typical effort to recover the lost data from Your last available back up.

12.3. Limitation Period. Except as stated in this Section, all claims must be made within the period specified by applicable law. If the law allows the parties to specify a shorter period for bringing claims, or the law does not provide a time at all, then claims must be made within 18 months after the cause of action accrues.

13. Additional Terms.

13.1. Notices. The parties will provide all notices under this EULA in writing. Unless provided otherwise in an Order, You must provide notices to the local Dell entity in Your Order, or, if Your Order is not with a Dell entity, by e-mail to Dell_Legal_Notices@dell.com.

13.2. Waiver and Severability. Failure to enforce a provision of this EULA will not constitute a waiver of that or any other provision of this EULA. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any part of this EULA or document that incorporates this EULA by reference is unenforceable, that ruling will not affect the validity of all remaining parts.

13.3. Modifications. This EULA may only be modified in writing signed by both parties; provided, however, that Licensor may, in its sole discretion, update the Licensor Table, the OST Table, the UOM Terms and the Subscription Terms at any time. Any changes that Licensor makes to the Licensor Table, the OST Table, the UOM Terms or the Subscription Terms will only apply to Orders that occur after Licensor posts those changes online.
 
13.4. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. If You obtained the Software directly from Dell, then the governing law and jurisdiction provisions set forth in Your Order Terms shall apply to this EULA. Otherwise the following shall apply:

A. Subject to Section 13.4 D and 13.5, if You are domiciled in the United States or Canada: (1) this EULA and any Dispute is governed by the laws of the State of Texas (excluding the conflicts of law rules) and the federal laws of the United States; and (2) to the extent permitted by law, the state and federal courts located in Texas will have exclusive jurisdiction for any Dispute. Both parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Travis or Williamson County, Texas, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by those courts and to venue in those courts.

B. Subject to Section 13.4 D, if You are domiciled outside of the United States or Canada: (1) this EULA and any Dispute is governed by the substantive laws in force in the country in which the Licensor is located (as indicated in the Licensor Table located at www.dell.com/swlicensortable), without regard to its conflict of law rules; and (2) the exclusive place of jurisdiction for any Dispute shall be in such country.

C. In any event, neither the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, nor the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act shall apply to this EULA or any Dispute.

D. If You are an individual consumer, this Section 13.4 does not deprive You of the protection afforded to You by the provisions of mandatory consumer protections laws that are applicable to You, nor does it prevent you from seeking remedies or enforcing your rights as a consumer under such laws.

13.5. Dispute Resolution and Binding Individual (non-class) Arbitration. This Section only applies if You are an individual consumer that resides in (or obtained the Software in) the United States or Canada. All Disputes shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding individual arbitration. This means You and Licensor waive any right to litigate disputes in a court or before a jury and neither You nor Licensor shall be entitled to join, consolidate, or include any claims belonging to or alleged or arising from, by or on behalf of any third party to an arbitration brought hereunder, or to arbitrate any claim as a class action, class representative, class member, or in a private attorney general capacity. If You reside in (or obtained the Software in) the United States, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), or JAMS. If You reside in (or obtained the Software in) Canada, arbitration will be at ADR Chambers pursuant to the general ADR Chambers Rules for Arbitration located at www.adrchambers.com. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitration panel shall have exclusive authority to resolve any arbitrability issues including any dispute over this EULA or this arbitration provision’s scope, application, meaning and enforceability. The arbitration panel shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court, including without limitation preliminary relief, injunctive relief and specific performance. Any award of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding immediately when rendered, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If any portion of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable portion shall be severed and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced (but in no event will there be a class arbitration). Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in small-claims court rather than arbitration. Licensor will be responsible for paying any individual consumer's arbitration/arbitrator fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor may apply to any relevant government agency or any court of competent jurisdiction to preserve its rights under this EULA and to obtain any injunctive or preliminary relief, or any award of specific performance, to which it may be entitled, either against You or against a non-party; provided, however, that no such administrative or judicial authority shall have the right or power to render a judgment or award (or to enjoin the rendering of an arbitral award) for damages that may be due to or from either party under this EULA, which right and power shall be reserved exclusively to an arbitration panel proceeding in accordance herewith.

13.6. Third Party Rights. Other than as expressly set out in this EULA, this EULA does not create any rights for any person who is not a party to it, and no person who is not a party to this EULA may enforce any of its terms or rely on any exclusion or limitation contained in it.

13.7 Entire Agreement. You acknowledge that You have read this EULA, that You understand it, that You agree to be bound by its terms, and that this EULA, along with the Order Terms into which this EULA may be incorporated (as applicable), is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between You and Licensor regarding Your use of the Software. All content referenced in this EULA by hyperlink is incorporated into this EULA in its entirety and is available to You in hardcopy form upon Your request. The pre-printed terms of Your purchase order or any other document that is not issued or signed by Licensor or Dell do not apply to Software. You represent that You did not rely on any representations or statements that do not appear in this EULA when accepting this EULA.


1. GRANT OF LICENSE:
Subject to the provisions contained herein and to the payment of all applicable fees, the American National Standards Institute, Inc. ("ANSI") grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to the materials contained herewith (the "Product"). Your licensed rights to the Product are limited to the following:

(a) This Agreement does not convey to you an interest in or to the Product, but only a limited right of use, revocable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) You may install one (1) copy of the Product on, and permit access to it by, a single computer owned, leased or otherwise controlled by you. In the event that computer becomes dysfunctional, such that you are unable to access the Product, you may transfer the Product to another computer, provided that the Product is removed from the computer from which it is transferred and the use of the Product on the replacement computer otherwise complies with the terms of this Agreement. You may print one (1) copy of the Product for personal use only. Neither concurrent use on two or more computers nor use in a local area network or other network is permitted. You shall not merge, adapt, translate, modify, rent, lease, sell, sublicense, assign or otherwise transfer the Product, or remove any proprietary notice or label appearing on any of the Product. You may make one (1) copy of the Product for backup purposes only.

(c) You acknowledge and agree that the Product is proprietary to the Copyright holder (the "Owner") identified on the front page of the Product, and is protected under U.S. copyright law and international copyright treaties. You acknowledge and agree that all provisions regarding the usage and copying of the Product in this Agreement replace all otherwise applicable limitations and privileges under the U.S. Copyright law, including, without limitation, the fair use doctrine. You further acknowledge and agree that all right, title and interest in and to the Product, including all intellectual property rights, are and shall remain with the Owner.

(d) You shall provide ANSI or any designee of ANSI with all information necessary to assure compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event you are not in compliance with the terms of this Agreement through the actions of unrelated third parties, you shall use your best efforts to cooperate with ANSI and any of its designees to assure compliance.

2.Limited Warranty:
(a) ANSI warrants for your benefit alone that, unless disclosed in the Product to the contrary, Owner and/or licensed distributor of the Product have granted ANSI the right to license the Product to you.

(b) THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE CONSTITUTES THE ONLY WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT AND ANSI MAKES NO OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (EITHER IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW) WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WITH RESPECT TO THE SUFFICIENCY, ACCURACY OR UTILIZATION OF, OR ANY INFORMATION OR OPINION CONTAINED OR REFLECTED IN, THE PRODUCT. ANSI EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, AGENT, REPRESENTATIVE OR PUBLISHER OF THE OWNER IS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATION, EXTENSION, OR ADDITION TO THIS LIMITED WARRANTY.

3. Idemnification:
The Owner, ANSI, any agent, representative, publisher or distributor of the Product, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or members (the "ANSI and Owner Indemnified Parties") shall have no liability for, and you shall defend, indemnify and hold each of the ANSI and Owner Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, any claim, loss, demand, liability, obligation and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) based upon or arising out of any injury or damage, or any product liability claim, including but not limited to, any personal or bodily injury or property damage, arising out of, pertaining to, or resulting in any way from, the use or possession of any of the Product, including, without limitation, infringement of third party rights, by you and/or any of your directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents or contractors.

4. Limitation of Liability:
(a) You acknowledge that each of ANSI and Owner's and/or Product distributor's obligations and liabilities with respect to the Product are exhaustively defined in this Agreement. You are responsible for the consequences of any use of the Product (whether or not such use was consistent with the license granted hereunder) created therefrom. Whether or not ANSI or Owner or the Product's distributor has been advised of their possibility, neither ANSI nor Owner nor any distributor of the Product nor any of their representatives or agents, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or members, shall be liable, whether under contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential loss, damage, cost or expense of any kind whatsoever and howsoever caused, that may be suffered by you or any of your directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or contractors or any third party.

(b) If at any time an allegation of infringement of any rights of any third party is made, or in ANSI or Owner's or Product distributor's opinion is likely to be made, with respect to any of the Product, ANSI may, at its option and at its own expense (i) obtain for you the right to continue using the Product, (ii) modify or replace the Product or any portion thereof so as to avoid any such claim of infringements, or (iii) refund to you the License Fee in return for you ceasing to use the Product. ANSI, the Owner and the Product distributor shall have no liability to you if any claim of infringement would have been avoided except for your refusal to use any modified or replacement Product supplied or offered to be supplied pursuant to this Section 4(b) or to otherwise cease using the Product. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, and except as set forth in this Section 4(b), ANSI and/or Owner's and/or Product distributor's liability to you for damages pursuant to this Section 4(b), if any, shall not exceed the amount of the License Fee paid by you for the Product subject to any such claim.

(c) Section 4(b) states the entire liability of ANSI and Owner and distributor of the Product with respect to an infringement or alleged infringement of any third party rights of any kind whatsoever by use of the Product.

5. Termination:
This Agreement may be terminated immediately by ANSI or Owner or distributor of the Product upon breach of any provision of this Agreement by you. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you shall immediately discontinue the use of the Product and shall, within ten (10) days, return files(s) on diskette(s), if any, to ANSI and certify in writing to ANSI that the Product, and any copy, has been deleted from your computer and is eliminated from your premises. Sections 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
6. Governing Law:
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without reference to its conflict of laws provisions. You consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts sitting in the City and State of New York.

7. Miscellaneous:
This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between ANSI and you with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supercedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements not specifically incorporated herein. This Agreement may not be modified except in writing duly signed by an authorized representative of ANSI and you. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and such decision shall not affect the enforceability (i) of such provision under other circumstances, or (ii) of the remaining provisions hereof under all circumstances. Headings shall not be considered in interpreting the Agreement. This Agreement and the rights granted to you may not be assigned or assignable, in whole or in part. For purposes of this Agreement, Owner shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary, with full rights to enforce its intellectual property rights hereunder.

8. Export:
You may not load or export or re-export any of the Product or any underlying information or technology except in full compliance with all United States and other applicable laws and regulations.

BY ACCESSING THE PRODUCT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

Please read the terms and conditions of this End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) carefully before you use the Solution (as defined below). This is a legally binding contract. By assenting electronically, or installing the Solution or using the Solution, you accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any entity or individual you represent or for whose Device you acquire the Solution (collectively “you”). If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not continue the installation process, do not use the Solution and delete or destroy all copies of the Solution in your possession or control.

This Agreement relates to your use of certain software (“Software”), services or hardware and related firmware, including any Updates (each, a “Solution”) in connection with which you are accepting this Agreement, and any related Documentation. In this Agreement, “Vendor” means the entity identified here as providing the Solution to you; “Documentation” means any user manuals and instructions provided with the Solution; and “Applicable Conditions” means collectively the Subscription Period together with the types of Devices, Permitted Number of Devices, other transaction terms, conditions and documents you accepted when you acquired the Solution (including any terms and conditions of sale), and any distribution agreement, reseller agreement, partner agreement or other agreement between you and Vendor or other member of Vendor Group, as well as the other limitations described by Section 2 and the Documentation.

Please note that this Agreement comes in two parts. Sections 1 through 12 of this Agreement apply to all Solutions, including those listed below. Section 13 sets out additional terms and conditions affecting specific Solutions or categories of Solutions, including Third Party Software, Services and other Products (Section 13.1); Managed Service Provider Licenses (Section 13.2); Browser Cleanup (Section 13.3); WiFi Finder (Section13.4); Avast Family Space (also sold as Star Guard Family, Vodafone Family Protect and WINDTRE Family Protect) (Section13.5); Mobile Apps (Section 13.6); Technician Edition (Section13.7); Assurance Plan (Section 13.8); Premium Technical Support (Section 13.9); Remote Access; Assistance Software (Section 13.10); Avast Driver Updater (Section 13.11), Avast Secure Web Gateway or Avast Secure Internet Gateway (Section13.12), certain HMA services (Section 13.13), Vendor’s Virtual Private Network Solutions (Section 13.14), any dongle or appliance Avast provides you as part of your subscription (Section 13.15), and Mobile Threat Intelligence Platform (Section 13.16). This Agreement supersedes and replaces any other agreement you previously entered into with respect to a prior version of the Solution.

Vendor may amend this Agreement at any time by notice provided to you in accordance with this Agreement, and your continued use of any affected Solution at any point at least 30 days after the notice date will constitute your acceptance of the amendment of this Agreement. Vendor may require that you accept the amended Agreement in order to continue using any affected Solution you have previously acquired. If you decline to accept the amended Agreement, Vendor may terminate your use of such affected Solution, in which case you may obtain a refund for the portion of the subscription fee you have paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Period by following the instructions found here.

1. LICENSE
Vendor grants to you a non-exclusive license to use the Solution and the Documentation for the agreed period indicated in the Applicable Conditions, including any extensions or renewals of the agreed period (the “Subscription Period”), provided that you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2. PERMITTED USE OF THE SOLUTION
2.1. You may use the Solution on, or to support, up to the agreed number (the “Permitted Number of Devices”) of mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, mobile network appliances, other mobile devices (each, a “Mobile Device”), personal computers, IoT and other Internet-connected devices, or other device compatible with the Solution (each, including each Mobile Device, a “Device”) indicated in the Applicable Conditions exclusively:

2.1.1. In the case of Solutions that Vendor designates for corporate, commercial or business use (each, a “Business Solution”), by you or your affiliates (those entities controlling you, controlled by you or under common control with you) for internal business purposes. In the event of any such use of the Business Solution by your affiliate, you are responsible for your affiliate’s compliance with this Agreement, and a breach by your affiliate will be deemed a breach by you. Any obligations of Vendor under this Agreement will be owed solely to you and not your affiliates that use the Business Solution under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2.1.2. In the case of all other Solutions, including Avast Free Antivirus, AVG Free Antivirus, CCleaner Free and all other Solutions for which you are not required to pay a subscription fee or other price either to obtain the Solution or to continue using the Solution after a trial period (each, a “Consumer Solution”), by a natural person, or members of his household for personal, noncommercial purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, no Consumer Solution is provided or licensed for use by any: (i) natural person for commercial purposes; or (ii) business, company, government entity, non-governmental organization or other not-for-profit entity, or educational institution.

2.2. You may make one backup copy of Software.

2.3.1. Permanent installation of Software onto hard disks or other storage devices for up to the Permitted Number of Devices; or

2.3.2. Use of the Solution over such single local area network, provided the number of different Devices on which the Solution is used does not exceed the Permitted Number of Devices; or

2.3.3. If the Applicable Conditions grant you the right to use the Solution in providing MSP Services, use of the Solution as described in Section 13.2.

2.4. YOUR USE OF THE SOLUTION OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY SECTION 2 OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY RESALE OR FURTHER DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOLUTION, CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY VIOLATE APPLICABLE COPYRIGHT LAWS.

3. UPDATES
Vendor, from time to time during the Subscription Period and without your separate permission or consent, may from time to time deploy an upgrade or update of, or replacement for, any Solution (“Update”), and as a result of any such deployment you may not be able to use the applicable Solution or Device (or certain functions of the Device) until any such Update is fully installed or activated. Each Update will be deemed to form a part of the “Solution” for all purposes under this Agreement. Updates may include both additions to, and removal of, any particular features or functionality offered by a Solution or may replace it entirely, and Vendor will determine the content, features and functionality of the updated Solution in its sole discretion. Vendor is not required to offer you the option to decline or delay Updates but, in any event, you may need to download and permit installation or activation of all available Updates to obtain maximum benefit from the Solution. Vendor may stop providing support for a Solution until you have accepted and installed or activated all Updates. Vendor in its sole discretion will determine when and if Updates are appropriate and has no obligation to make any Updates available to you. Vendor in its sole discretion may stop providing Updates for any version of the Solution other than the most current version, or Updates supporting use of the Solution in connection with any versions of operating systems, email programs, browser programs and other software with which the Solution is designed to operate.

4. OWNERSHIP RIGHTS
4.1. The Solutions and Documentation are the intellectual property of Vendor and are protected by applicable copyright laws, international treaty provisions and other applicable laws of the country in which the Solution is being used. The structure, organization and computer code of any Software and firmware are valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Vendor. To the extent you provide any comments or suggestions about the Solution to Vendor, you grant Vendor the right and license to retain and use any such comments or suggestions for any purpose in its current or future products or services, without further compensation to you and without your approval of such retention or use.

4.2. Except as stated in this Agreement, your possession, use of a Solution does not grant you any rights or title to any intellectual property rights in the Solution or Documentation. All rights to the Solution and Documentation, including all associated copyrights, patents, trade secret rights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, are reserved by Vendor.

5. RESTRICTIONS
5.1. You may not copy or use the Solution or the Documentation except as set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement. You may not, and may not permit any third party to:

5.1.1. use any authorization code, license number, username/password combination or other activation code or number supplied by Vendor in connection with any Solution (“Activation Code”) on, or for, more than the number of Devices specified by the Applicable Conditions;

5.1.2. disclose any Activation Code to any party other than Vendor or Vendor’s designated representatives;

5.1.3. except as expressly authorized by law: (i) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, reconstruct, transform or extract any Solution or any portion of the Solution (including any related Malicious Code (as defined below) signatures and Malicious Code detection routines); or (ii) change, modify or otherwise alter any Solution (including any related Malicious Code signatures and Malicious Code detection routines). “Malicious Code” means any code, feature, routine or device intended, or designed automatically, or on a certain event occurring, or on your taking or failing to take a certain action, or at the direction or control of any person or entity, to: (a) disrupt the operation of any software, service, device, property, network or data; (b) cause any software, service, device, property, network or data to be destroyed, altered, erased, damaged, or otherwise cause its operation to be disrupted or degraded; or (c) permit any person or entity to access, take control of, or destroy, alter, erase, damage, or otherwise disrupt or degrade the operation of any portion of any software, service, device, property, network or data, and any computer virus, worm, trap door, back door, time bomb, malicious program, or a mechanism such as a software lock or routine for password checking, CPU serial number checking, time dependency or any other code intended or designed to enable any matters described in this definition (including Java applets, ActiveX controls, scripting languages, browser plug-ins or pushed content);

5.1.11. violate Vendor’s policy governing acceptable use of its Solutions (the “Acceptable Use Policy”), which you can find here. If and to the extent this Agreement and the Acceptable Use Policy conflict, the more restrictive provision will govern.

5.2. Certain Solutions may grant you or another user administrative privileges that, among other things, may allow the administrator to monitor other Devices and/or the status of Solutions deployed on other Devices, including for example Subscription Period status, Solution messages, and Updates. You represent and warrant that you will exercise such administrative privileges only with respect to Devices and Solutions for which you are duly authorized and for no other purpose. You also represent and warrant to Vendor that: (i) you have all the requisite authority to accept this Agreement, and install and/or use the Solution on the Devices, on behalf of any owners and users of those administered Devices; and (ii) you hereby accept this Agreement for and on behalf of: (A) any such owners and users of those administered Devices; and (B) yourself.

5.3. Certain Solutions may enable you to publish or share publicly with others, content you have generated or obtained from other sources (“User Content”). You retain any and all intellectual property rights you already hold under applicable law in User Content you publish or share through the Solution, subject to the rights, licenses, and other terms of this Agreement, including any underlying rights of others in any User Content that you may use or modify. You grant to each member of the Vendor Group, a non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and royalty-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, resell, sublicense (through multiple levels), modify, adapt, display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of the User Content you publish or share through a Solution (and derivative works thereof), solely for the purpose of providing the Solutions to you under this Agreement. Each time you publish or share any User Content, you represent and warrant to each member of the Vendor Group that you are at least the age of majority in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside and are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any User Content you publish or share, and that, in regard to that User Content: (i) you are the sole author and owner of the intellectual property and other rights to the User Content, or you have a lawful right to publish and share the User Content and grant each member of the Vendor Group the right to use it as described in this Section 5.3, all without any obligation being imposed on any member of the Vendor Group to obtain the consent of any third party and without creating any obligation or liability whatsoever for any member of Vendor Group; (ii) the User Content is accurate; (iii) the User Content does not and, as to each member of the Vendor Group’s permitted uses and exploitation set forth in this Agreement, will not infringe any intellectual property or other right of any third party; and (iv) the User Content will not violate this Agreement or cause injury or harm to any person.

Subject to the remainder of this Section 6, Vendor warrants to you that the Solution will perform, or will be performed, substantially in accordance with the Documentation for a period of 30 days following your initial acquisition of the Solution. To make a warranty claim, you must follow the instructions provided by the source from which you acquired the Solution. If the Solution does not perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation, the entire and exclusive liability of each member of the Vendor Group and each Vendor Partner, and your sole and exclusive remedy, in respect of such warranty will be limited to, at Vendor’s option, to either: (i) replacement of the Solution; or (ii) return of the Solution to obtain a refund for the portion of the subscription fee you have paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Period.

EXCEPT AS STATED IN SECTION 6.1 OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE SOLUTION IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND MEMBERS OF THE VENDOR GROUP AND VENDOR PARTNERS MAKE NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS AND, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS IMPLIED BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, JURISPRUDENCE OR OTHER THEORIES OF LAW, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, SUITABLE QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. VENDOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF ANY SOLUTION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, THAT ANY SOLUTION WILL WORK PROPERLY ON ANY GIVEN DEVICE OR WITH ANY PARTICULAR CONFIGURATION OF HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE, OR THAT ANY SOLUTION WILL PROVIDE COMPLETE PROTECTION FOR THE INTEGRITY OF SELECTED DATA, INFORMATION OR CONTENT STORED OR TRANSMITTED VIA THE INTERNET.

6.3. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY SOLUTION PROVIDED TO YOU WITHOUT FEES (INCLUDING ANY SOLUTION PROVIDED AS A “FREE,” “TRIAL” OR “BETA” SOLUTION) IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS,” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND WITHOUT SUPPORT OR OTHER SERVICES BY VENDOR.

6.4. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL VENDOR OR ANY COMPANY THAT CONTROLS, IS CONTROLLED BY OR IS UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH VENDOR (COLLECTIVELY, THE “VENDOR GROUP”) OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, LICENSORS, REPRESENTATIVES, SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, WIRELESS CARRIERS OVER WHOSE NETWORK OR SYSTEMS ANY SOLUTION IS PROVIDED, OR ANY OTHER BUSINESS PARTNER OF ANY MEMBER OF THE VENDOR GROUP (COLLECTIVELY, THE “VENDOR PARTNERS”) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR:

6.4.1. ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR LOSSES WHATSOEVER, WITHOUT REGARD TO CAUSE OR THEORY OF LIABILITY;

6.4.3. ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR NONPECUNIARY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SOLUTION PROVIDED HEREUNDER;

EVEN IF SUCH MEMBER OF THE VENDOR GROUP OR VENDOR PARTNER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.

6.5.2. ANY MATTER THAT MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE LIMITED OR EXCLUDED BY APPLICABLE LAWS.

7. PRIVACY; PROCESSING OF PERSONAL AND OTHER INFORMATION
7.1. The term “Data,” as used in this Agreement and the Privacy Policy, means: (a) the information you provide to Vendor, another member of the Vendor Group, or a Vendor Partner in the course of ordering Solutions, including your name, billing address (including postal code), email address, phone number, payment card or account number, payment card or account verification code, payment card commencement date and expiration date, the account password you select for your account with Vendor or another member of the Vendor Group, and other Billing Data as defined in Vendor’s Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”, which you can find here) (collectively, “Transaction Data”); (b) information Vendor, another member of the Vendor Group or a Vendor Partner collects in the course of processing and fulfilling your orders for Solutions, including information about the make, model, operating system and other identifying details of your Device, the name of your Internet service provider, your Internet Protocol (IP) address; and (c) information about your installation and use of Solutions ((b) and (c) collectively being referred to as “Service Data” in the Privacy Policy).

7.2. You authorize Vendor, another member of the Vendor Group or a Vendor Partner, to use your Data, for the purposes described in the Privacy Policy. You acknowledge that such use of your Data includes processing and fulfilling your orders for subscriptions, improving Solutions, and providing information to you about the Solutions to which you have subscribed and offering you other Solutions. You acknowledge that Vendor or another member of the Vendor Group may share your Data with Vendor Partners such as Vendor’s ecommerce platform providers and payment processors, suppliers providing support, services and Solutions to you on Vendor’s behalf, and suppliers providing Vendor or a member of the Vendor Group with purchase analytics and crash analytics in respect of Solutions. You also acknowledge that Vendor or a member of the Vendor Group may share Data that is anonymized and aggregated with third parties for trend analytics.

8. TERMINATION
8.1. This Agreement will immediately terminate upon your breach of any of your obligations in this Agreement (including any breach of your obligations in Sections 2, 5 or 10), which will result in forfeiture of any rights you may have to receive Updates or to obtain a refund for the portion of the subscription fee you have paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Period. Vendor reserves the right to any other remedies available under law in the event your breach of any of your obligations under this Agreement adversely affects any member of the Vendor Group or any Vendor Partner. The exclusions and limitations of liability of members of the Vendor Group and Vendor Partners contained in this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement.

8.2. Vendor, by notice to you, may immediately terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time with respect to any particular Solution or all Solutions and the entire and exclusive liability of each member of the Vendor Group and each Vendor Partner, and your sole and exclusive remedy, in respect of any such termination will be limited to a refund for the portion of the subscription fees you have paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Period. From the effective date of such termination you will no longer be entitled to use any affected Solution and Documentation.

8.3. If a Subscription Period is conditioned on you paying a fee or charge, and if Vendor has not received payment by the 15th day following the payment due date, you will be deemed to have surrendered your license to use the Solution, and the license will terminate immediately without further action by you or Vendor.

9. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS
All Solutions qualify as “commercial items,” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users acquire such Solutions and related Documentation with only those rights set forth in this Agreement that apply to non-governmental customers. Use of such Solutions and related Documentation constitutes agreement by the U.S. Government entity that the computer software and computer software documentation is commercial, and constitutes acceptance of the rights and restrictions set forth in this Agreement.

10. EXPORT CONTROLS
You must comply with all applicable U.S. and international laws governing export and re-export of the Solutions, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. Without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, you represent, warrant and undertake that: (i) you are not a member of any of the denied persons list, unverified list, entity list, specially designated nationals list, debarred list or any other lists published by the U.S. Government; and (ii) you will not use, export or re-export any Solution in, or to, territories, destinations, companies or individuals in violation of U.S. and E.U. embargoes or trade sanctions. You will indemnify, defend and hold each member of the Vendor Group harmless from and against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding, and all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses arising from your failure to comply with this Section 10.

11. BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
11.1. This Section 11 applies to any Dispute arising from or related to any Solution, subscription for any Solution or this Agreement, and involving you and Vendor. “Dispute,” for the purposes of this Section 11, means any dispute, action, or other controversy regardless of the particular cause of action(s) asserted (i.e., it encompasses, among any other potential cause of action or legal basis, claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation or fraud, indemnification, tort (including negligence and strict product liability), and violation of statute or regulation).

11.2. In the event of a Dispute, you must provide Vendor with a notice of Dispute, which is a written statement of your name, address and contact information, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested by you. You must send any notice of Dispute by email to Vendor at legal@avast.com (stating Subject: Section 11 Notice of Dispute Under EULA).

11.3. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU WILL NOT SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.

11.4. If you and Vendor do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and the substantive laws of the State of New York (without regard to choice of laws principles). Except as provided in Section 11.5 below, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in litigation as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right to judicial review under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.

11.5. The arbitration requirement of this Section 11 is subject to the following exceptions:

11.5.1. You may litigate any Dispute in small claims court, in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. If you initiate a claim in small claims court, you are responsible for all court costs and fees.

11.5.2. All Disputes concerning any alleged misappropriation of your or Vendor’s intellectual property will be resolved in court.

11.5.3. If you are a consumer and live in the European Union, Norway, Iceland or Lichtenstein, you may be entitled to address your Dispute through an internet platform for online dispute resolution established by the European Commission (the “ODR Platform”). The ODR Platform is intended to facilitate out-of-court resolutions relating to online purchases of goods and services between consumers and traders based in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. You will find the ODR Platform by following this link: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.

11.6. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in accordance with the AAA’s “Consumer Arbitration Rules” effective September 1, 2014, including the “Costs of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)” effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the “Consumer Procedures”) and will be subject to the following:

11.6.1. The Consumer Procedures provide for certain fees, specifically allocating some to the consumer (you) and others to the business (Vendor). If your claim is US$75,000 or less, Vendor will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer. Vendor does not agree to bear any other costs. If your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.

11.6.2. Except as provided in below, the AAA’s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties. However, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a final decision. This Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures. You will commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted by conference call. However, if the proceedings are conducted pursuant to the AAA Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator(s) will have the discretionary authority to require a face-to-face hearing upon the request of a party.

11.6.3. You and the Vendor agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties’ agreement to arbitrate Disputes. If the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and Vendor will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the AAA’s Consumer Procedures.

11.6.4. If one or more parts of this Section 11 are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of this Section 11 and all other provisions of this Agreement. If such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such court proceeding will be the courts sitting in the county of New York, New York, U.S. For purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, the New York, New York courts’ personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.

11.7. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Section 11, if you acquired a Solution for other than personal or household use, the arbitration proceedings, including the payment of costs, will be administered in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “Commercial Procedures”). The Commercial Procedures are appropriately applied to any Dispute between the parties, and you will not advocate otherwise in any proceeding. However, this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Commercial Procedures.

12. GENERAL
12.1. Notice. Vendor may at any time deliver any notice to you via electronic mail, pop-up window, dialog box or other means, even though in some cases you may not receive the notice unless and until you launch a Solution. Any such notice will be deemed delivered on the date Vendor first makes it available through a Solution, irrespective of when you actually receive it.

12.2. Questions About This Agreement. If you have any questions regarding this Agreement or wish to request any information from Vendor, please write to Avast Software s.r.o., Pikrtova 1737/1a, Prague 4, Postal Code 140 00, Czech Republic, email: support@avast.com, tel.: +420 274 005 777 or visit our support page at www.avast.com/support.

12.3. Separate Agreements. If you acquired two or more Solutions, even in a single transaction, or you acquired subscriptions to any one Solution in multiple transactions, you may have accepted this End User License Agreement multiple times. Although the terms and conditions you accepted may be similar or identical, each time you accepted the terms and conditions of this End User License Agreement you entered into a different and separate agreement between you and the Vendor providing the applicable Solution.

12.4. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Vendor relating to your use of the Solutions and Documentation. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, statements, warranties and representations with respect to your installation and/or use of the Solutions or Documentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will diminish any rights you may have under existing consumer protection legislation or other applicable laws in your jurisdiction that may not be waived by contract. This Agreement, the Applicable Conditions and the Documentation, to the greatest extent reasonably practicable, will be construed to be consistent with each other, but in the event of a conflict they will govern in the following order of precedence: (i) the Applicable Conditions; (ii) this Agreement; and (iii) the Documentation.

12.5. Interpretation. The headings in this Agreement do not affect its interpretation. The use of any gender includes all genders. The singular includes the plural and vice-versa. Where a word or phrase is defined, its other grammatical forms have a corresponding meaning. The words “includes” and “including” will be construed as followed by the words “without limitation.” Any reference to “use” of any software, Solution or Update by you shall be deemed to include any installation of any such software, Solution or Update by you (unless the context otherwise requires). This Agreement was originally prepared in the English language. Although Vendor may provide one or more translated versions of this Agreement for your convenience, the English language version of this Agreement will be the governing version of this Agreement in the case of any conflict or discrepancy. In the event that an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, in any judicial proceeding or otherwise, the terms of this Agreement will be construed as having been drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

12.6. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable laws, it shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement but the remainder of this Agreement will remain valid and enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.

12.7. Impossibility. Vendor will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance, due in whole or in part, to utility failures (including power), failure of the internet, failure of telecommunications or information technology services, failure of telecommunications or information technology equipment, strikes or other labor disturbances (including without limitation a strike or other labor disturbance arising in respect of any members of the Vendor Group or any Vendor Partners), acts of war or terror, denial of service attacks or other information technology attacks or breaches affecting any member of the Vendor Group or any Vendor Partner, floods, sabotage, fire, other natural disasters or Acts of God, or any other cause beyond any member of Vendor Group or Vendor Partner’s reasonable control.

12.8. Waiver. The failure of either party to insist upon the strict performance of any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of future compliance with this Agreement, and the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement on the part of either party shall be effective for any purpose whatsoever unless such waiver is in writing and signed by such party. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party shall not be construed as a continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of other breaches of the same or of other provisions of this Agreement.

12.9. Assignment. You may not assign your rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Vendor. Vendor may assign this Agreement at any time in its sole discretion without any prior written consent by you.

12.10. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any person other than you, members of the Vendor Group and Vendor Partners, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. No person other than you, Vendor and members of the Vendor Group may bring a cause of action pursuant to this Agreement. Vendor will be entitled (but not obligated) to enforce any rights, remedies, limitations and exclusions of liability, and legal defenses of any member of Vendor Group or Vendor Partner under this Agreement, including any rights and remedies for any loss, damage or claim suffered or incurred by any member of Vendor Group or Vendor Partner: (i) arising from or in connection with any failure by you to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement; or (ii) you are required to indemnify under this Agreement. No such loss, damage or claim will be deemed excluded as indirect, consequential or incidental loss or damage under Section 6.4.1 as a result of such loss, damage or claim having been suffered or incurred by another member of Vendor Group or Vendor Partner rather than by Vendor.

12.11. Governing Law. The law governing this Agreement and any Dispute (as defined in Section 11) will be the substantive law of the State of New York, U.S., without regard to choice of laws principles. This Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.

12.12. Internet connection. Certain Solutions may require an active and stable connection to the Internet in order to function. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that you have at all times an active and stable Internet connection.

12.13. Product names. Vendor from time to time may change the name of a Solution, or change the name or logo applied to the Solution to the name or logo of another member of the Vendor Group or a Vendor Partner. These changes do not alter your subscription for any Solution, the Subscription Period or this Agreement, and do not give you any right to terminate your subscription for a Solution, the Subscription Period or this Agreement.

13. SPECIAL TERMS
The following special terms apply to certain Solutions. If these special terms conflict with the remainder of the Agreement, these special terms will govern and take precedence with respect to the applicable Solutions.

13.6. Mobile Apps. This Section 13.6 applies to any Solution intended for use on Mobile Devices.

13.6.1. For any Solution downloaded from Google Play (http://play.google.com), the license granted by this Agreement is in lieu of any rights to use a Solution that would otherwise be granted by the default terms for applications downloaded from the Google Play Store.

13.6.2. For any Solution downloaded from the Apple App Store, the following terms apply:

(a) The licenses granted by this Agreement are limited to a non-transferable license to use the Solution on any iPhone, iPod Touch or other Apple-powered Device that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple App Stores Terms of Service, available online at http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html or through such sites and other means made available to you by Apple.

(b) This Agreement is concluded solely between the parties, and not with Apple. Vendor, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Solution and the content of such Solution.

(c) Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Solution.

(d) If the Solution fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Solution to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Solution, and that, as between you, Vendor and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be Vendor’s sole responsibility.

(e) Vendor, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Solution or your possession and/or use of that Solution, including: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Solution fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

(f) In the event of any third party claim that the Solution or your possession and use of that Solution infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Vendor, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.

(g) You must comply with any applicable third party terms when using the Solution. For example, for a VOIP Solution, you must not violate your wireless data service agreement when using the Solution.

(h) Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and, on your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary.

13.6.3. For Solutions downloaded from the Amazon Appstore, Amazon may designate certain customer terms of use for the Amazon Appstore as “Default EULA Terms.” Those Default EULA Terms will apply to your use of Solutions you purchase through the Amazon Appstore. The Default EULA Terms will specify, among other things, that Vendor is the licensor of the Solution and Amazon is not a party to this Agreement. If there are any conflicts between the Default EULA Terms and this Agreement, then to the extent of such conflict the Default EULA Terms will govern and take precedence. Amazon does not have any responsibility or liability related to compliance or non-compliance by Vendor or you with the Default EULA Terms.

13.7. Technician Edition. This Section 13.7 applies to the extent you have purchased the Technician Edition of a Solution. You may permit the number of technicians specified by the Applicable Conditions to use the Solution to perform optimization services and repairs to Devices owned by you (if you purchased an enterprise subscription) or third parties (if you purchased a breakfix subscription). Each technician may install the Solution on only one Device at any given time, and must remove the Solution from the Device before returning control of the Device to the user.

13.8. Assurance Plan. This Section 13.8 applies to Assurance Plans.

13.8.1. “Assurance Plan” means a service under which Vendor’s technician (an “Associate”), in exchange for a separate subscription fee, will assist you to remove viruses or other Malicious Code that infects your protected Device during the Subscription Period. Assurance Plans are sold together with certain Vendor antivirus Solutions or other security Solutions (each, a “Security Solution”), and supplement the protections offered by the Security Solution.

13.8.2. If you request Vendor’s assistance under the Assurance Plan, and if you and your Device qualify for assistance under Section 13.8.3, Vendor will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist you to remove the viruses or other Malicious Code affecting your Device. You hereby acknowledge, accept and agree that Vendor’s efforts may not be enough to remove certain viruses or other Malicious Code from your Device, and that Vendor, in the course of providing service, may alter, delete or corrupt data on your Device, change Device settings, or otherwise interfere with the proper operation of your Device.

13.8.3. The Assurance Plan covers: (i) only the Device for which you purchased the related Security Solution, and may not be transferred to another Device; and (ii) only viruses and other Malicious Code infecting the Device during the Subscription Period, after you downloaded and installed the Security Solution on the Device, and while the Security Solution was running with up-to-date Malicious Code definitions. Vendor may terminate the Assurance Plan without notice if it determines in its sole business judgment that you have requested or received service under the Assurance Plan for a Device not covered by the Assurance Plan, transferred or attempted to transfer the Assurance Plan to another person or entity, or otherwise breached the terms of the Assurance Plan.

13.8.4. Vendor, in providing assistance under the Assurance Plan, may require remote access to your Device, and/or may require that you install Assistance Software, in which case you acknowledge and agree that that Section 13.10 applies. If you cannot or do not provide remote access to your Device and/or you cannot or do not download and install the Assistance Software on the Device or follow Vendor’s or Associate’s other instructions, or if Vendor determines your Device does not qualify for support under the Assurance Plan, Vendor will not provide service under the Assurance Plan. Vendor may (but is not required to) refer you to a service under which Vendor or its subcontractor, for a fee, will provide assistance.

13.9. Premium Technical Support. This Section 13.9 applies to Avast Total Care, AVG Premium Tech Support, AVG Go and other technical support services (each, “Premium Technical Support”) that Vendor sells separately from its software Solutions, and through which Vendor may help you install, configure or troubleshoot any of a variety of software products and/or equipment or systems, including a PC, Mac, tablet, mobile phone or any other personal computing device, wireless router, cable modem or other router, printer, digital camera, media player, Smart TV and DVD/Blu-Ray player.

13.9.1. The Associate, in providing Premium Technical Support, will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist you with the problems you are experiencing but, due to the variety and the complexity of technologies available on the market, the Associate may not be able to resolve your issues. This may include, for example, problems that arise as a result of software or hardware errors not yet resolved by the manufacturer, or problems related to the equipment configuration that makes it impossible or unreasonably difficult for the Associate to properly diagnose and solve the issue. As a result, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Vendor’s efforts may not be enough to solve the issues you identify, or that those issues will not be solved in a timely manner.

13.9.2. The Associate, in providing Premium Technical Support, may require remote access to your Device, and/or may require that you install Assistance Software, in which case you acknowledge and agree that that Section 13.10 applies. If you cannot or do not provide remote access to your Device and/or you cannot or do not download and install the Assistance Software on the Device or follow Vendor’s or Associate’s other instructions, or if Vendor determines your Device does not qualify for support under the Premium Technical Support subscription, Vendor will not provide Premium Technical Support.

13.10. Remote Access; Assistance Software

13.10.1. Remote Access. Vendor or an Associate, when providing services under the Assurance Plan, as part of Premium Technical Support or in connection with other services, may need to remotely connect to, and take control of, your equipment in order to resolve the issues that you are experiencing. In connection with this remote connection session:

(a) The Associate may need to run various scripts on your equipment, make changes to its configuration, install and uninstall software, and make other changes to the equipment and/or software settings of such equipment as may be necessary to address your issues. You understand that the Associate may, but is not obligated to, install and remove various proprietary or third party software tools where the Associate deems it necessary to assist you with the issues that you are experiencing. Elements of such software are protected by law, including copyright.

(b) You acknowledge and agree that, by authorizing the Associate to establish a remote connection session, you grant Vendor (and partners and contractors acting on Vendor’s behalf) full or limited access to your equipment, software and network (depending on your equipment, software and network configuration), and authorize Vendor to make such modifications as described above or as otherwise advised by the Associate during delivery of the Solution. You acknowledge and agree that the Associate, or you acting on the Associate’s direction may alter, delete or corrupt software or data on your equipment, change equipment, software or network settings, or otherwise interfere with the proper operation of your equipment, software or network.

(c) You acknowledge and agree that the Associate may have access to any information stored on your Device. Associates are trained not to access more information than necessary to resolve the issues for which you are requesting the Associate’s support. You must nevertheless remain in front of your Device screen to observe the actions of the Associate while he or she delivers the Solution on your Device. You will have the opportunity to end the live support session at any time by advising the Associate or disconnecting the remote connection session.

13.10.2. Assistance Software.

(a) Vendor or an Associate, as a condition to providing services under the Assurance Plan, Premium Technical Support or other services, may instruct you to download and install on the Device a software program (the “Assistance Software”) allowing the Associate to gain remote access to your Device, gather information about the Device and its operations, diagnose and repair the problem, and change Device settings. You may also need to follow other instructions given by the Vendor or an Associate.

(b) If you or an Associate installs Assistance Software on a Device, that Assistance Software:

(i) May require that you activate it on your Device. If you do not complete the activation process within the period of time requested by the Associate or as prompted by the Assistance Software, the Assistance Software may cease to function until the activation is complete.

(ii) May communicate with Vendor’s (or its partner’s or contractor’s) servers on a regular basis to: (i) ensure that you receive all the services and software you are eligible to as part of your Solution; (ii) enable you to promptly launch a chat session with an Associate as part of your Solution; or (iii) give you access to certain self-service tools as part of your Solution.

(iii) May by default constantly run on your Device and perform various background tasks that help maintain your Device in working condition. When running, it may collect various data regarding your Device, including its technical specifications, information regarding its operating system, downloaded and/or installed software, updates and upgrades, the availability and the status of your security software, backups and firewalls, various unique identifiers, system and software error messages, network connections status, connected peripherals and other connected devices, and similar such information and data. This information helps Vendor to prevent many common issues that you may be experiencing, and also to quickly identify problems for which you may be requesting Vendor’s support.

13.11. Avast Driver Updater

13.11.1. Avast Driver Updater is intended for use on a Device that is a single physical computer, and not a “virtual machine” in which a shared computing resource emulates the functions of several dedicated physical computers. Avast Driver Updater will not be as effective when used on a virtual machine rather than a physical computer.

13.11.2. Avast Driver Updater relies on manufacturer-provided data in device driver installation files, including release dates, to provide information displayed by the Solution in scan results. MEMBERS OF THE VENDOR GROUP AND VENDOR PARTNERS DO NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT ANY DEVICE DRIVER PROVIDED BY THE SOLUTION WILL BE THE LATEST, OR ANY PARTICULAR VERSION, OF SUCH DEVICE DRIVER NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DIFFERENT OR CONTRARY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SOLUTION.

13.12.1. As used in this Section 13.12:

(a) “Aggregated Data” means data: (i) anonymized, and not identifiable to any individual person or entity; (ii) combined with the data of other users of an Avast Secure Gateway, and/or additional data sources; and (iii) presented in a manner by which individual users of an Avast Secure Gateway may not be identified.

(b) “Avast Secure Gateway” means the Avast Secure Web Gateway or Avast Secure Internet Gateway;

(c) “DNS Transaction” means a recursive DNS query you send through your use of Avast Secure Web Gateway.

(d) “Seat” means a subscription for an individual that accesses the Internet in connection with an Avast Secure Gateway, as further described by Section 13.12.5. A Seat may only be transferred from one such individual to another such individual if the original individual is no longer permitted to access, and does not access, the Internet in connection with the Avast Secure Gateway.

(e) “Transaction” means an HTTP or HTTPS request sent to, or by, you through your use of the Avast Secure Internet Gateway.

13.12.2. You must not, from any Device protected by an Avast Secure Gateway: (i) send spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of any applicable laws; (ii) send infringing, obscene, threatening, libelous, or illegal material; (iii) access blocked services in violation of any applicable laws; or (iv) run automated queries to Internet URLs.

13.12.3. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) in order for Vendor to provide the Avast Secure Gateway, you must forward your Internet traffic to Vendor via valid forwarding mechanisms that allow for automatic fail-over (i.e. DNS, PAC, IPSEC, GRE tunnels or an appropriate Vendor Solution); (ii) you are responsible for supplying Vendor with any technical data and other information Vendor may reasonably request from time to time; (iii) Vendor Group and Vendor Partners may use the Malicious Code (as defined in Section 13.16.1(b)), spam, botnets, or other information derived from your use of an Avast Secure Gateway for the purposes of: (1) maintaining, improving and/or analyzing the Avast Secure Gateways; (2) complying with any legal or contractual requirements; or (3) making malicious or unwanted content anonymously available to Vendor Partners for the purpose of further developing and enhancing the Avast Secure Gateways; and (iv) Vendor Group and Vendor Partners may develop and commercialize benchmarks and measures based on Aggregated Data.

13.12.4. Vendor Group and Vendor Partners reserve the right to manage bandwidth or route traffic across the Internet in a commercially optimal way, provided such actions do not compromise Vendor’s obligations with respect to the Avast Secure Gateways. Vendor or a Vendor Partner (as applicable) may suspend your access to, or download of, the Avast Secure Gateways in the event your use of these Solutions represents an imminent threat to any network of Vendor Group or a Vendor Partner, or if required to comply with applicable laws. In such circumstances, Vendor or Vendor Partner (as applicable) will: (i) suspend the Avast Secure Gateways only to the extent reasonably necessary to prevent any harm to any network of Vendor Group or Vendor Partners (for example, blocking offending source IP addresses) and to comply with applicable laws; (ii) use its reasonable efforts to contact you promptly and give you the opportunity to promptly change the configuration of you server(s) accordingly and/or work with you to promptly resolve the issues causing the suspension of the Avast Secure Gateways; and (iii) reinstate any such suspended Avast Secure Gateways after all such issues are resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of Vendor or Vendor Partner (as applicable).

13.12.5. For the purposes of determining whether you have purchased sufficient Seats, every 2,000 Transactions per calendar day flowing through the Avast Secure Internet Gateway shall be considered an Avast Secure Internet Gateway “Seat,” and every 2,000 DNS Transactions per calendar day flowing through Avast Secure Web Gateway shall be considered an Avast Secure Web Gateway “Seat.” You acknowledge and agree that the number of Seats you are required to purchase for your use of: (i) Avast Secure Internet Gateway will be calculated by dividing the total number of Transactions flowing through Avast Secure Internet Gateway per calendar day, by 2,000; and (ii) Avast Secure Web Gateway will be calculated by dividing the total number of DNS Transactions flowing through Avast Secure Web Gateway per calendar day, by 2,000.

13.12.6.  Although Vendor may not charge you separately for bandwidth in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway, Vendor and the relevant Vendor Partner incur significant bandwidth costs in providing of the Avast Secure Gateway to you. Accordingly, a material increase in your bandwidth consumption in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway will significantly affect and disrupt the business operations of Vendor and the Vendor Partner. You acknowledge and agree that, in circumstances where your bandwidth consumption in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway materially exceeds the number of DNS Transactions, or DNS Transactions per Seat, specified by the Applicable Conditions, Vendor or the Vendor Partner may notify you, in which case you must negotiate in good faith with Vendor: (i) on a bandwidth reduction plan; and/or (ii) to increase the pricing for of the Avast Secure Gateway for the remainder of the Subscription Term. If you are unable to reach a mutually agreeable resolution with Vendor within thirty (30) days from the date of notification by Vendor or Vendor Partner (as applicable), then Vendor may on thirty (30) days’ notice, terminate the remaining portion of your Subscription Term for the Avast Secure Gateway and refund to you any portion of the subscription fees you have pre-paid for the unused portion of the Subscription Term.

13.12.7. You acknowledge and agree that Vendor Group and Vendor Partners may use, reproduce, store, modify, and display the information from your transaction logs (i.e. the metadata of all network traffic sent to, or received from, you through your use of an Avast Secure Gateway) (the “Transaction Logs”). Transaction Logs will be retained by Vendor Group or Vendor Partners for rolling 6 month periods during the Subscription Period. On termination or expiration of the Subscription Period, the Transaction Logs shall be deleted by Vendor Group and Vendor Partners pursuant to the standard retention cycle of Vendor Group and Vendor Partners, or earlier as you may request in writing.

13.13. Certain HMA Solutions

13.13.1. Virtual Private Network. Unless otherwise provided by the Applicable Conditions, your subscription to the HMA Virtual Private Network product (the “HMA VPN”) authorizes you to create no more than 5 simultaneous connections in respect of each HMA VPN subscription. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you exceed the number of simultaneous connections authorized for your HMA VPN subscription, Vendor may at any time without any prior notice to you, suspend or disable your access to, and/or use of, the HMA VPN. If you wish to increase the authorized number of simultaneous connections for your HMA VPN subscription, please contact us at sales@hidemyass.com.

13.13.2. Web Proxy. The HMA web proxy service (“Web Proxy”) is a free Solution that does not require you to register your details with Vendor. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for, and Vendor Group and Vendor Partners accept no liability to you or any third party for: (a) your access, viewing or use of, or the contents of (including any offensive or objectionable content), any third party website accessed or viewed while using Web Proxy; (b) your compliance with the terms of use applicable to any third party website you access, visit or use while using the Web Proxy; and (c) any claim, loss or damage arising from any content that you create, make available, transmit or display while using Web Proxy, including any claim, loss or damage suffered or incurred by Vendor Group or Vendor Partners.

13.14. Virtual Private Networks. Several countries prohibit or restrict the use of virtual private networks (“VPNs”), and some have instituted technological measures to prevent VPNs from working. As a result, Vendor’s VPN Solutions (including the HMA VPN) are subject to territorial restrictions that may change from time to time. You can find further information here.

13.15. Appliance. Vendor may provide you with a dongle or other appliance (the “Appliance”) as a part of your Solution, in which case the additional provisions set forth in this Section 13.15 will apply:

13.15.1. The limited warranty period established by Section 6.1 is extended for the Appliance to 1 year from the date of purchase (the “Appliance Warranty Period”).

13.15.2. You must notify Vendor promptly if the Appliance is or becomes defective. If you notify Vendor of the defect during the Appliance Warranty Period and Vendor is unable to remedy the defect remotely, Vendor at its option and expense within 5business days will either: (a) replace the Appliance with a new or refurbished unit of the Appliance, in which case the warranty established by Section 6.1 will apply for the remainder of the Appliance Warranty Period applicable to the original unit of the Appliance; or (b) terminate your subscription and refund any unearned subscription fees you have previously paid. If the Appliance fails following the end of the Appliance Warranty Period, or if it fails because of misuse, tampering, interference, abuse, casualty, loss or theft, Vendor may charge you its standard price for the replacement unit of the Appliance. Vendor in its sole discretion may replace the Appliance with a new or different appliance that will also be subject to this Agreement (including Section13.15).

13.16.2. Vendor Content, as between you and the Vendor Group, is the property of the members of the Vendor Group. Members of the Vendor Group, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, grant you a limited, non-exclusive license to use and access Vendor Content as made available to you on the MTIP solely in connection with your use of the MTIP.

13.16.3. The availability of any Content on the MTIP does not amount to an endorsement or verification of such content by any member of the Vendor Group. Members of the Vendor Group make no warranties or representations regarding the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Content made available on the MTIP. Members of the Vendor Group are not providing any advice or recommendations to you by making Content available on the MTIP (including in respect of Vendor Content) and, accordingly, you must form your own judgments and decisions based upon your own due diligence and investigations, and must not place any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Content made available on the MTIP.

13.16.4. By uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content on the MTIP, you grant members of the Vendor Group a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, upload, publish, transmit, store, display, distribute, make available to others, and otherwise use Your Content in connection with the operation or use of the MTIP or the promotion, advertising or marketing of the MTIP, in any and all media or distribution methods or modes of making the MTIP or Content available to others (now known or later developed). You agree that this license includes the right for members of the Vendor Group to make Your Content available to Vendor Partners who collaborate with members of the Vendor Group for the uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content through other media or distribution methods or modes of making the MTIP or Content available to others. This license also includes the right for other users of the MTIP to use and modify Your Content.

13.16.7. For the avoidance of doubt, Sections 4, 5.1.7, 5.1.11 and 5.3 (“Pertinent Sections”) shall be applicable to Your Content and your use of the MTIP (including uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making Your Content available on the MTIP). This Section 13.16 and the Pertinent Sections, to the greatest extent practicable, will be construed to be consistent with each other, but in the event of a conflict they will govern in the following order of precedence: (i) this Section 13.16; and (ii) the Pertinent Sections.

MINECRAFT END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
In order to protect Minecraft (our "Game") and the members of our community, we need these end user license terms to set out some rules for downloading and using our Game. This license is a legal agreement between you and us (Mojang AB) and describes the terms and conditions for using the Game. We don't like reading license documents any more than you do, so we have tried to keep this as short as possible. If you break these rules we may stop you from using our Game. If we think it is necessary, we might even have to ask our lawyers to help out.

If you buy, download, use or play our Game, you are agreeing to stick to the rules of these end user license agreement ("EULA") terms. If you don't want to or can't agree to these rules, then you must not buy, download, use or play our Game. This EULA incorporates the terms of use for the mojang.com website ("Account Terms"), our brand and asset usage guidelines, our privacy policy, and, if you live in the United States, our Arbitration Agreement. By agreeing to this EULA you also agree to all of the terms of the foregoing documents, so please read through them carefully.

BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES
For those that who live in the United States, please click here to review the binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver that is part of this EULA. Under the agreement, we both agree to use a neutral arbitrator to decide any individual claims that may arise and thus agree to waive our rights to bring individual claims in court for consideration by a judge or jury. We also agree that class action lawsuits and class-wide arbitrations are not allowed under the terms of the agreement.

The complete Arbitration Agreement is on this page. You and we agree to it; please read it.

ONE MAJOR RULE
The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we've made unless we specifically agree to it. By "distribute anything we've made" what we mean is:

give copies of our Game to anyone else;
make commercial use of anything we've made;
try to make money from anything we've made; or
let other people get access to anything we've made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;
unless we specifically agree to it. And so that we are crystal clear, "the Game" or "what we have made" includes, but is not limited to, the client or the server software for our Game and includes Minecraft and Minecraft: Java Edition on all platforms. It also includes updates, patches, downloadable content, add-ons, or modified versions of a Game, part of those things, or anything else we've made.

Otherwise we are quite relaxed about what you do - in fact we really encourage you to do cool stuff - but just don't do those things that we say you can't.

USING OUR GAME
You have been granted a license to the Game so you can play and use it, yourself, on your devices.

Below we also give you limited rights to do other things but we have to draw a line somewhere or else people will go too far. If you wish to make something pertaining to anything we've made we're humbled, but please make sure that it can't be interpreted as being official and that it complies with this EULA and the brand and asset usage guidelines and above all do not make commercial use of anything we've made.

The license and permission we give you to use and play our Game can be revoked if you break any of the terms of this EULA.

When you buy our Game, you receive a license that gives you permission to install the Game on your own personal device and use and play it on that device as set out in this EULA. This permission is personal to you, so you are not allowed to distribute the Game (or any part of it) to anyone else. This also means you cannot sell or rent the Game, or make it available for access to other people and you cannot pass on or resell any license keys. You may however give gift codes that have been bought through our official gift code system. This is important to help us stop piracy and fraud and to protect our Game. It is also important to prevent members of our community from buying pirated versions of our Game or fraudulent license keys - which we may cancel, such as in the case of fraud.

If you've bought the Game, you may play around with it and modify it by adding modifications, tools, or plugins, which we will refer to collectively as "Mods." By "Mods," we mean something original that you or someone else created that doesn't contain a substantial part of our copyrightable code or content. When you combine your Mod with the Minecraft software, we will call that combination a "Modded Version" of the Game. We have the final say on what constitutes a Mod and what doesn't. You may not distribute any Modded Versions of our Game or software, and we’d appreciate it if you didn’t use Mods for griefing. Basically, Mods are okay to distribute; hacked versions or Modded Versions of the Game client or server software are not okay to distribute.

Within reason you're free to do whatever you want with screenshots and videos of the Game. By "within reason" we mean that you can't make any commercial use of them or do things that are unfair or adversely affect our rights unless we've specifically said it's okay in this EULA, allowed it through the Brand and Asset Usage Guidelines, or provided for it in a specific agreement with you. If you upload videos of the game to video sharing and streaming sites you are however allowed to put ads on them. Also, don't just rip art resources and pass them around, that's no fun.

Essentially the simple rule is do not make commercial use of anything we've made unless we've specifically said it's okay. Oh and if the law expressly allows it, such as under a "fair use" or fair dealing" doctrine then that's ok too - but only to the extent that the law applicable to you says so.

In order to ensure the integrity of the Game, we need all Game downloads and updates to come from an authorized source. It's also important for us that 3rd party tools/services don't seem "official" as we can't guarantee their quality. It's part of the responsibility we have to the customers of Minecraft. Make sure that you read through our brand and asset usage guidelines too.

OWNERSHIP OF OUR GAME AND OTHER THINGS
Although we license you permission to install on your device and play our Game, we are still the owners of it. We are also the owners of our brands and any content contained in the Game. Therefore, when you pay for our Game, you are buying a license to play / use our Game in accordance with this EULA - you are not buying the Game itself. The only permissions you have in connection with the Game and your installation of it are the permissions set out in this EULA.

Any Mods you create for the Game from scratch belong to you (including pre-run Mods and in-memory Mods) and you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you don't sell them for money / try to make money from them and so long as you don’t distribute Modded Versions of the Game. Remember that a Mod means something that is your original work and that does not contain a substantial part of our code or content. You only own what you created; you do not own our code or content.

CONTENT
If you make any content available on or through our Game, you agree to give us permission to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and publicly display that content. This permission is irrevocable, and you also agree to let us permit other people to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and publicly display your content. You are not giving up your ownership rights in your content, you are just giving us and other users permission to use it. For example, we may need to copy, reformat, and distribute content that you post on our website so others can read it. If you don't want to give us these permissions, do not make content available on or through our Game. Please think carefully before you make any content available, because it may be made public and might even be used by other people in a way you don't like.

If you are going to make something available on or through our Game, it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it must be your own creation. Some examples of the types of things you must not make available using our Game include: posts that include racist or homophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that are offensive or that damage our or another person's reputation; posts that include porn or someone else's creation or image; or posts that impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.

Any content you make available on our Game must also be your creation or you must have permission or the legal right to do it. You must not and you agree that you will not make any content available, using the Game that infringes the rights of others. '

We reserve the right to take down any content in our discretion.

Please watch out if you are talking to people in our Game. It is hard for either you or us to know for sure that what people say is true, or even if people are really who they say they are. You should think twice about giving out information about yourself.

UPDATES
We might make upgrades, updates or patches (we call them all "updates") available from time to time, but we don't have to. We are also not obliged to provide ongoing support or maintenance of any Game. Of course, we hope to continue to release new updates for our Game, we just can't guarantee that we will do so. With updates come changes that might not work well with other software, such as Mods. This is unfortunate, but it is something we don’t take responsibility for. If that is the case, try running an older version.

OUR LIABILITY, GOVERNING LAW, AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES

The terms of this EULA do not affect any legal (statutory) rights that you may have under the law that applies to you for the Game. You might have certain rights which the law that applies to you says cannot be excluded. Nothing we say in these terms will affect those legal rights, even if we say something which sounds like it contradicts your legal rights. That’s what we mean when we say “subject to applicable law”.

SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, When you get a copy of our Game, we provide it "'as is"'. Updates are also provided "'as is"'. This means that we are not making any promises to you about the standard or quality of our Game, or that our Game will be uninterrupted or error free. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that it may cause. You bear the entire risk as to its quality and performance. You have to accept that we may release games well before they are complete and so they may (and often will) have bugs -but we prefer to release these features early than make you wait for perfection. If you would like to notify us about a potential bug, we have a site for that here.

If you and we ever have a dispute in court (and we hope that won't happen just as much as you do), the exclusive forum (that is, the place it will be handled) will be a state or federal court in King County, WA (if you live in the United States) or a court in Ontario (if you live in Canada). (If you live in the United States, most disputes go to arbitration, not court.) The laws of your state or province govern this EULA and all disputes, including disputes relating to it, our Game, or our Website, regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the Federal Arbitration Act governs everything related to arbitration.

TERMINATION
If we want we can terminate this EULA if you breach any of the terms. You can terminate it too, at any time; all you have to do is uninstall the Game from your device and the EULA will be terminated. If the EULA is terminated, you will no longer have any of the rights to the Game given in this license. You do still have the right to things you have created yourself with the game of course. The Arbitration Agreement (if you live in the United States) and the paragraphs about "Ownership of Our Game", "Our Liability" and "General Stuff" will continue to apply even after the EULA is terminated.

GENERAL STUFF
Your local law may give you rights that this EULA cannot change; if so, this EULA applies as far as the law allows. Nothing in this license limits our liability for death or bodily injury resulting from our negligence or fraudulent misrepresentations.

We may change this EULA from time to time, if we have reason to, such as changes to our games, our practices, or our legal obligation. But those changes will be effective only to the extent that they can legally apply. For example if you use the Game only in single-player mode and don't use the updates we make available then the old EULA applies but if you do use the updates or use parts of the game that rely on our providing ongoing online services then the new EULA will apply. In that case we'll inform you of the change before it takes effect, either by posting a notice on our Website or by other reasonable means. We're not going to be unfair about this though - but sometimes the law changes or someone does something that affects other users of the Game and we therefore need to put a lid on it.

If you come to us with a suggestion for any one of our Websites or Games, that suggestion is made for free and we have no obligation to accept or consider it. This means we can use or not use your suggestion in any way we want and we don't have to pay you for it. If you think you have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you for, please do not submit your suggestion unless you have first told us you expect to be paid and we have responded in writing by asking you to submit the suggestion.

Virtual Items are not redeemable or subject to refund and cannot be traded outside of the Application for money or other items of value. Outfit7 may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items and the price for Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice. Outfit7 shall have no liability to You or any third party in the event that Outfit7 exercises any such rights.

By signing up for a subscription, You agree that Your subscription will be automatically renewed and, unless You cancel Your subscription, You authorize us to charge Your account for the renewal term. The period of auto-renewal and the price of subscription will be the same as Your initial subscription period and price, unless otherwise disclosed to You at the time of sale. You can manage Your subscriptions in Your app store account settings. You should be aware that deleting the Application from Your device does not always result in the cancellation of Your subscription. For more detailed information on how to manage In-App Purchases, please see our Frequently Asked Question available at http://outfit7.com/contact/.

In-App Purchases range from EUR 0.89 to EUR 99.99. All rates are in EUR currency and are subject to change and localization to the local currency, which shall be done by the app store from which You downloaded the App, meaning that the prices may vary plus/minus 15%. You should always check the prices in the Application to get the real values of the Virtual Items You want to buy in Your territory.

In-App Purchases are subject to the payment terms and conditions of the mobile platform (e.g. iOS Platform, Android Platform, Windows Platform, etc.) from which You make Your purchase. Outfit7 does not control or manage the payment process. Please review the relevant terms and conditions of the applicable platform provider before making any In-App Purchases.

ALL PURCHASES ARE FINAL. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUTFIT7 IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS/SUBSCRIPTIONS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

Outfit7 reserves the right, using its sole discretion, to terminate this EULA, or request that You remove the Application from Your device for any reason, including but not limited to Outfit7’s reasonable conclusion that You have violated this EULA.

material license shortfall of 5% or more is found, You must reimburse Licensor for the costs incurred in the audit.

only be brought before a federal or state court of appropriate jurisdiction in Utah. If a party initiates Agreement-related legal
proceedings, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees. If, however, Your country of principal residence
is a member state of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association, (1) the courts of Ireland shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over any action of law relating to this Agreement; and (2) where the laws of such country of principal residence are required
to be applied to any such action of law the laws of that country shall apply. The application of the United Nations Convention of
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with any other purchase documents or other agreement between You and Licensor,
sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between You and Licensor and may be amended or modified only by a written
agreement agreed to by You and an authorized representative of Licensor. NO LICENSOR, DISTRIBUTOR, DEALER, RETAILER,
RESELLER, SALES PERSON, OR EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT OR TO MAKE ANY

the party to be bound. No waiver of any past or present right arising from any breach or failure to perform will be deemed to be a
waiver of any future right arising under this Agreement.

This Novell Software License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between You (an entity or a person) and Novell, Inc.
(“Novell”). The software product identified in the title of this Agreement for which You acquired licenses, any media and
accompanying documentation (collectively the “Software”) is protected by the copyright laws and treaties of the United States
(“U.S.”) and other countries and is subject to the terms of this Agreement. Any update or support release to the Software that You
may download or receive that is not accompanied by a license agreement expressly superseding this Agreement is Software and
governed by this Agreement. If the Software is an update or support release, then You must have validly licensed the version and
quantity of the Software being updated or supported in order to install or use the update or support release.
The Software may include or be bundled with other software programs licensed under different terms and/or licensed by a licensor
other than Novell. Use of any software programs accompanied by a separate license agreement is governed by that separate
license agreement. Any third party software that may be provided with the Software is included for use at Your option.
LICENSED USE
Commercial Software.
The individual components of the Access Governance Suite 4.1 may include a software license in addition to this Agreement. In the
event of conflict between this Agreement and any such additional software license, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall
prevail. This suite license allows use of any Software in the suite by a single user or appliance as specified below.
"User" means a user object in a single directory tree (or other class of object that contains data representing a person, such as
objects containing credit card information or PIN numbers) that has (a) access or use rights to any portion of the Software, or (b)
access or use rights to products (devices, hardware, or software) being managed by the Software, regardless of whether the user
object is assigned to a person or device. User objects (or other classes of objects) representing the same person that are linked to
each other within a single tree and/or linked across multiple trees count as only one User.
"Appliance" means the Access Governance Development Appliance or the Access Governance Production Appliance from which
you access and use the Software.

one user object uniquely assigned to that person and access the Software through the user object. Provided that You comply with
the above requirements, You are authorized to use an unlimited number of copies of the Software.
Evaluation Software. If the Software is an evaluation version or is provided to You for evaluation purposes, then Your license to
use the Software is limited solely to internal evaluation purposes and in accordance with the terms of the evaluation offering under
which You received the Software and expires 90 days from installation (or such other period as may be indicated within the
Software). Upon expiration of the evaluation period, You must discontinue use of the Software, return to an original state any
actions performed by the Software, and delete the Software entirely from Your system. The Software may contain an automatic
disabling mechanism that prevents its use after a certain period of time, so You should back up Your system and take other
measures to prevent any loss of files or data.

basis or multiple devices if licensed on a device or server basis.

protection or maintenance only entitles You to upgrades of the Software as a whole and does not entitle You to upgrades of any
component programs or products bundled with the Software or any individual products included in a suite if the Software is licensed
as a suite of products. You may separately purchase upgrade protection for individual components of the Software if permitted by
the applicable Novell policies and programs.

means the product from which You are upgrading. You are authorized to use the Software only if You are the authorized user of the

Original Product that You acquired legally and that is qualified to be upgraded with the Software under the Novell policies existing at

the applicable license agreement; and (3) You will not sell or otherwise transfer possession of the Original Product.

LIMITED WARRANTY
For ninety (90) days from Your date of purchase, Licensor warrants that the Software will substantially conform to its accompanying
documentation. If You report the nonconformity to Licensor within ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, Licensor will at its sole
discretion either resolve the nonconformity or refund the license fees You paid for the Software. Any unauthorized use or modification

OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. The foregoing warranty does not apply to Software provided free of charge.
SUCH SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.

the amount You paid to Licensor for the portion of the Services that fail to comply with this warranty. You agree to take appropriate
measures to isolate and back up Your systems.

EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES WILL SATISFY YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL OPERATING SYSTEMS, OR THAT THE
OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. THE FOREGOING
EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT AND FORMED THE BASIS FOR 
DETERMINING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR THE PRODUCTS. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers and limitations

sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between You and Licensor and may be amended or modified only by a written
agreement agreed to by You and an authorized representative of Licensor. NO LICENSOR, DISTRIBUTOR, DEALER, RETAILER,
RESELLER, SALES PERSON, OR EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT OR TO MAKE ANY

the party to be bound. No waiver of any past or present right arising from any breach or failure to perform will be deemed to be a
waiver of any future right arising under this Agreement.
Severability. If any provision in this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be construed, limited, modified or, if
necessary, severed, to the extent necessary, to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, and the other provisions of this Agreement
will remain unaffected.

including without limitation injunctive relief, Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days, purchase sufficient licenses and or subscriptions
and associated support and maintenance to cure the Non-Compliance, without benefit of any otherwise applicable discount, by
paying Licensor’s current (as of the date of such additional purchase) list license fees and 12-month support and maintenance fees to
Licensor for such additional licenses, plus Licensor’s current (as of the date of such additional purchase) list term license and support
and maintenance fees and interest (compounded at 1.5% monthly or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law if lower) for such

material license shortfall of 5% or more is found, Licensee shall also reimburse Licensor for the reasonable cost of such audit in
addition to other amounts due. The obligations in this Section 3 shall apply to both Licensee’s Non-Compliance and any third party’s
Non-Compliance.
4 DOCUMENTATION. One (1) electronic copy of Licensor’s standard Documentation, describing Licensor’s recommended use and
application of the Licensed Software, will be furnished or made available on Licensor’s website free of additional charge to Licensee

Order, specified in Annex 1 or Annex 2, or as otherwise agreed in writing between the Licensee and Licensor), and is subject to
earlier termination as provided in this Section 5. If Licensee has purchased a subscription/term license, Licensee’s license to the
Licensed Software shall automatically terminate upon expiry of such subscription/term. Licensor may terminate this License
Agreement and Licensee’s license to the Licensed Software immediately by giving Licensee written notice of termination in the event

within ten (10) days of the date of notice from Licensor to Licensee or (ii) Licensee is wound up, has a receiver appointed or has
applied for or enters into liquidation or bankruptcy or analogous process or processes. Termination shall be without prejudice to any

6 SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE. Where Licensee purchases support and/or maintenance services, Licensee’s initial support and/or
maintenance term will begin upon delivery to Licensee of the Licensed Software and continue for one (1) year thereafter (or the length
of the term if less than a year for any subscription/term license) unless otherwise specified in the applicable annual support and/or
maintenance agreement, Product Order, or other written agreement executed between Licensor and Licensee. Where Licensee
purchases support and/or maintenance for any Licensed Software, Licensee hereby agrees that it shall purchase such support and/or

7 LIMITED WARRANTY. Licensor warrants for the Warranty Period (i) that if the Licensed Software is supplied via media, then the
media will be free from defects in materials or workmanship under normal use and (ii) that the copy of the Licensed Software
delivered to Licensee conforms in all material respects to the Documentation. As the sole and exclusive remedy for not meeting part
(i) of the above warranty, Licensor’s sole obligation shall be to repair or replace free of charge any defective media on which the
Licensed Software is delivered if the media is returned to Licensor by Licensee during the Warranty Period. As the sole and exclusive
remedy for not meeting part (ii) of the above warranty, Licensor shall repair or replace the Licensed Software free of charge so that it
conforms with the warranty or, if Licensor reasonably determines that such remedy is not economically or technically feasible,
Licensee shall be entitled to a full refund of the license fee and any maintenance fee paid by Licensee with respect to that particular
Licensed Software. Upon such refund Licensee’s license to use such Licensed Software will terminate. The warranty set forth in this

with the Documentation, this License Agreement or with the platform(s) for which the Licensed Software has been designed and licensed
by Licensor; or (b) the Licensed Software having been altered, modified or converted by Licensee or any third party except as may be
specified in the Documentation; or (c) the malfunctioning of Licensee’s equipment; or (d) accident or abuse; or (e) service by any

Software is not designed and licensed for operation; or (g) Third Party Software (as defined herein); or (h) any other cause occurring
after initial delivery of the media to Licensee unless caused directly by Licensor. The foregoing states the complete and entire
remedies that Licensee has under this warranty. Licensor shall have no responsibility for any warranty claims made outside of the
Warranty Period. The foregoing warranty shall not apply to any free-of-charge Licensed Software including updates, though issues
with such software may be eligible for support under applicable support terms and conditions.
8 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The Licensed Software cannot be tested in every possible operating environment, therefore Licensor
does not warrant that the functions contained in the Licensed Software will meet Licensee’s requirements, that operation of the

12 THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AND COMPONENTS. The Licensed Software may come with and/or require certain named third party
software programs that Licensee shall license directly from the third party subject to such third party’s terms and conditions (for
example Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Internet Explorer) (“Third Party Software”). Any Third Party Software is provided by the licensor of
the Third Party Software solely under a direct license between such third party and Licensee under such third party’s terms and
conditions. Therefore the obligations, duties and rights of Licensor and Licensee under this License Agreement do not apply to such Third
Party Software. Additionally, Licensor has embedded in some Licensed Software certain run time or other elements provided by third
party suppliers to Licensor (“Third Party Components”). Such Third Party Components may also be loaded on the Licensed Software
media. Third Party Components are licensed to Licensee pursuant to this License Agreement. Third Party Components may also
include open source software, details of which (where applicable) may be found (i) in a file accompanying the applicable Licensed
Software or (ii) in the applicable Documentation. Licensee may only access Third Party Components of the Licensed Software in the
course of using the Licensed Software. Licensee may not make or attempt any direct access to any such Third Party Components
other than with the Licensed Software. All limitations, restrictions and obligations applicable to the Licensed Software set forth in this
License Agreement shall apply to Licensee’s use of the Third Party Components. The Third Party Software and Third Party
Components are the property of its respective third party supplier to Licensor. Such third party suppliers own all copies of the Third
Party Software and Third Party Components, however made. Licensee agrees not to contest the ownership of the Third Party
Software and Third Party Components nor use any trademark or service mark belonging to such third party suppliers. Licensee
agrees that such third party suppliers are intended third party beneficiaries of all terms and conditions of this License Agreement
intended to protect intellectual property rights in the Licensed Software (including the Third Party Components) and limit certain uses
thereof. Nothing in this License Agreement shall restrict, limit or otherwise affect any rights or obligations Licensee may have, or
conditions to which Licensee may be subject, under any applicable open source licenses to any open source code contained in the
Licensed Software.

assets of Licensee shall be included in the meaning of an assignment) nor duties delegated by either party, and any attempt to do so
will be void.

ANNEX 1, LICENSE OPTIONS
Definitions
“Change Guardian” hereafter refers to the Licensed Software.
“Server Components” refer to any Change Guardian software product component identified as a “server component” in the Documentation.
“Agent” means a single server or workstation having an installed copy of the Change Guardian agent software.
“Module” means a software component characterized as a “module” and made available for optional purchase and installation.
“Object” means the objects set forth in the table below that constitute the licensing metrics for the applicable Modules (such as Microsoft
Windows server, Active Directory Domain or Account, etc).
“Organization” means a legal entity, excluding subsidiaries and affiliates with a separate existence for tax purposes or for legal personality
purposes. An example of an Organization in the private sector would be a corporation, partnership, or trust, excluding any subsidiaries or
affiliates of the organization possessing a separate tax identification number or company registration number. In the public sector, an
example of an Organization would be a specific government body or agency.
“Non-production” use of the Software is defined as an installation of the Software solely for the purposes of development and testing. Data
collected by Non-production Instances shall be used only for the purpose of executing a defined development or testing task, and not for
the detection of actual threats to the Organization's IT environment.
“Server Class” means a host that is primarily designed to act as a server, accepting and servicing network requests from multiple clients.
The operating system on such hosts is typically designed to handle server workloads. For Microsoft Windows, server class operating
systems are typically identified by year (e.g. Windows 2012); for SUSE Linux, by name (e.g. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server); other vendors
may use similar designations. This also applies to NetApp appliances.
“Workstation Class” means a host that is primarily designed to act as a user workstation, with a small number of users logging in locally.
The operating system on such hosts is typically designed for single-user workloads. For Microsoft Windows, workstation class operating
systems are typically identified by number (e.g. Windows 7, Windows 10); for SUSE Linux, by name (e.g. SUSE Linux Enterprise
Desktop); other vendors may use similar designations. This does not apply to NetApp appliances.

GENERAL TERMS
Term. This Agreement becomes effective on the date You legally acquire the Software and will automatically terminate if You

internal safeguards to prevent any unauthorized copying, distribution, installation, or use of, or access to, the Software. You further
agree to keep records sufficient to certify your compliance with this Agreement, and, upon request of Novell, provide and certify
metrics and/or reports based upon such records and accounting both numbers of copies (by product and version) and network
architectures as they may reasonably relate to your licensing and deployment of the Software. You shall provide Novell or an
authorized representative with access to records, hardware and employees in order to perform the audit. Upon Novell’s or its
authorized representative’s presentation of their reasonable written commitment(s) to safeguard your confidential information, you

reveals that you have or at any time have had unlicensed installation, use of, or access to the Software, You will promptly acquire
sufficient licenses to cover any shortage. If a material license shortage of 5% or more is found, you must reimburse Novell for the
costs incurred in the audit and acquire the necessary additional licenses within 30 days without the benefit of any otherwise
applicable discount.

performing testing on the Software at the direction of or on behalf of a software developer or licensor. You may not, without Novell's
prior written consent not to be unreasonably withheld, publish or disclose to any third party the results of any benchmark test of the
Software. If You are a licensor of products that are functionally similar to or compete with the Software (“Similar Products”), or are
acting on behalf of such a licensor, and You publish or disclose benchmark information on the Software in violation of this restriction,
then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Similar Product's end user license agreement, and in addition to any other
remedies Novell may have, Novell shall have the right to perform benchmark testing on Similar Products and to disclose and publish
that benchmark information and You hereby represent that You have authority to grant such right to Novell.

by the laws of that country, and any action at law may only be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction of that country.
Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between You and Novell and may be
amended or modified only by a written agreement agreed to by You and an authorized representative of Novell. NO LICENSOR,
DISTRIBUTOR, DEALER, RETAILER, RESELLER, SALES PERSON, OR EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MODIFY THIS
AGREEMENT OR TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM, OR IN ADDITION TO, THE
TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
Waiver. No waiver of any right under this Agreement will be effective unless in writing, signed by a duly authorized representative of
the party to be bound. No waiver of any past or present right arising from any breach or failure to perform will be deemed to be a
waiver of any future right arising under this Agreement.
Severability. If any provision in this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be construed, limited, modified or, if
necessary, severed, to the extent necessary, to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, and the other provisions of this Agreement
will remain unaffected.

This Novell Software License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between You (an entity or a person) and Novell, Inc.
(“Novell”). The software product identified in the title of this Agreement for which You acquired licenses, any media and
accompanying documentation (collectively the “Software”) is protected by the copyright laws and treaties of the United States
(“U.S.”) and other countries and is subject to the terms of this Agreement. Any update or support release to the Software that You
may download or receive that is not accompanied by a license agreement expressly superseding this Agreement is Software and
governed by this Agreement. If the Software is an update or support release, then You must have validly licensed the version and
quantity of the Software being updated or supported in order to install or use the update or support release.
The Software may include or be bundled with other software programs licensed under different terms and/or licensed by a licensor
other than Novell. Use of any software programs accompanied by a separate license agreement is governed by that separate
license agreement. Any third party software that may be provided with the Software is included for use at Your option.
LICENSED USE
Commercial Software.
The individual components of the Access Governance Suite 4.1 may include a software license in addition to this Agreement. In the
event of conflict between this Agreement and any such additional software license, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall
prevail. This suite license allows use of any Software in the suite by a single user or appliance as specified below.
"User" means a user object in a single directory tree (or other class of object that contains data representing a person, such as
objects containing credit card information or PIN numbers) that has (a) access or use rights to any portion of the Software, or (b)
access or use rights to products (devices, hardware, or software) being managed by the Software, regardless of whether the user
object is assigned to a person or device. User objects (or other classes of objects) representing the same person that are linked to
each other within a single tree and/or linked across multiple trees count as only one User.
"Appliance" means the Access Governance Development Appliance or the Access Governance Production Appliance from which
you access and use the Software.
"Instance" means the initial copy of the Software necessary for execution of the Software and each additional copy (or partial copy)
of the Software stored or loaded in memory or virtual memory.
You must acquire a user license for each User and an Instance license for each Appliance. You must acquire either Access
Governance Suite or Roles Lifecycle Manager licenses to turn the Role Manager Option within the Administrative tab "On"; You
must acquire either Access Governance Suite or Compliance Certification Manager licenses to create or perform User or User
Group reviews; You must acquire either Access Governance Suite or Access Request and Change Manager licenses to turn the

one user object uniquely assigned to that person and access the Software through the user object. Provided that You comply with
the above requirements, You are authorized to use an unlimited number of copies of the Software.
Evaluation Software. If the Software is an evaluation version or is provided to You for evaluation purposes, then Your license to
use the Software is limited solely to internal evaluation purposes and in accordance with the terms of the evaluation offering under
which You received the Software and expires 90 days from installation (or such other period as may be indicated within the
Software). Upon expiration of the evaluation period, You must discontinue use of the Software, return to an original state any
actions performed by the Software, and delete the Software entirely from Your system. The Software may contain an automatic
disabling mechanism that prevents its use after a certain period of time, so You should back up Your system and take other
measures to prevent any loss of files or data.

products in the suite. The suite license does not allow use of individual products in the suite by multiple users if licensed on a user
basis or multiple devices if licensed on a device or server basis.

protection or maintenance only entitles You to upgrades of the Software as a whole and does not entitle You to upgrades of any
component programs or products bundled with the Software or any individual products included in a suite if the Software is licensed
as a suite of products. You may separately purchase upgrade protection for individual components of the Software if permitted by
the applicable Novell policies and programs.
Upgrade Software. This section applies to You if You have purchased the Software based upon upgrade pricing. “Original Product”
means the product from which You are upgrading. You are authorized to use the Software only if You are the authorized user of the

Original Product that You acquired legally and that is qualified to be upgraded with the Software under the Novell policies existing at
the time You acquired the Software; (2) You installed and used the Original Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the applicable license agreement; and (3) You will not sell or otherwise transfer possession of the Original Product.

You make such a purchase and no separate agreement specifically applies to the support services, then the terms of this
Agreement will govern the provision of such support services (“Services”). For more information on Novell's current support
offerings, see http://www.novell.com/support.

TO LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED RESELLER FOR THE PRODUCT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE
CLAIM. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PRODUCT IS CUMULATIVE AND NOT PER
INCIDENT (I.E. THE EXISTENCE OF TWO OR MORE CLAIMS WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT). IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFIT, OR LOST OR
DAMAGED DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF CAPITAL, COST TO COVER OR FOR
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWSOEVER

EACH CASE, LICENSOR, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS, HAVE BEEN ADHGSED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF

APPLY TO LICENSEE.
THIS DISCLAIMER AND EXCLUSION SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET
FORTH ABOVE FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

18. WAIVER. The failure of HGS to insist on the performance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement
or to exercise any right hereunder shall not be a waiver of such terms, conditions, or rights in the future, nor shall
it be deemed to be a waiver of any other term, condition, or right under this Agreement.

Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement For Publishing
To see the EULA change log click here. 
Please read this Agreement carefully. It is a legal document that explains your rights and obligations related to your use of the Unreal® Engine and related content. By downloading or using this software or any related content, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, please do not download or use this software or any related content.

Certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this Agreement. Those words and phrases are defined below in Section 25.

If your primary residence (or primary place of business, if you are a legal entity like a corporation or an academic institution) is in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games, Inc. If it is not in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games International S.à r.l., acting through its Swiss branch.

If you are separately licensed by Epic under a Custom License or the Unreal® Creator EULA, certain terms of this Agreement do not apply to your Custom Products or Unreal® Creator Products. Those terms are described below in Section 26.

1. License Grant

Epic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as described in this Agreement) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the Licensed Technology for any lawful purpose (the “License”). However, the rights that Epic grants you under the License are subject to the terms of this Agreement, and you may only make use of the License if you comply with all applicable terms.

The License becomes effective on the date you accept this Agreement or download the Engine Code or any Content. The License does not grant you any title or ownership in the Licensed Technology.

(A) Allowed forms of Distribution and Sublicensing

There is no restriction on your Distribution of a Product made using the Licensed Technology that does not include any Engine Code or any Paid Content Distributed in uncooked source format (in each case, including as modified by you under the License) and does not require any Licensed Technology (including as modified by you under the License) to run (“Unrestricted Products”). For clarity, the foregoing does not constitute a license under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

You may only Distribute the Licensed Technology as follows:

a. Distribution to end users - You may Distribute the Licensed Technology incorporated in object code format only as an inseparable part of a Product to end users who are subject to an end user license agreement which explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Licensed Technology. The Product may not contain any Paid Content Distributed in uncooked source format or any Engine Tools.

b. Distribution to other licensees - You may Distribute Engine Code (including as modified by you under the License) in Source Code or object code format, or any Content, to an Engine Licensee who has rights under its license to the same Version of the Engine Code or Content that you are Distributing.

Any public Distribution (i.e., intended for Engine Licensees generally) which includes Engine Tools (including as modified by you under the License) must take place either through the Marketplace (e.g., for distributing a Product’s modding tool or editor to end users) or through a fork of Epic’s GitHub UnrealEngine Network (e.g., for distributing source code).

c. Distributions to employees and contractors - You also may Distribute Content (other than Paid Plug-ins) to an Engine Licensee who is your employee or your contractor who does not have rights under their license to the same Content, but only to permit that Engine Licensee to utilize that Content in good faith to develop a Product on your behalf for Distribution by you under the License, and not for the purpose of Content pooling or any other Distribution or sublicensing of Content that is not permitted under this Agreement. Recipients of such a Distribution have a limited license to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify that Content to develop your Product as outlined above, and for no other purpose.

d. Distribution of Paid Plug-ins - You may Distribute Paid Plug-ins to each of your Paid Plug-in Users so that they may use those Paid Plug-ins on your behalf under the License.

e. Distribution and sublicensing of Examples - You may Distribute or sublicense Examples (including as modified by you under the License) in Source Code or object code format to any third party. However, the rights in this Section 1(e) do not expand or modify your limited Distribution and sublicensing rights for Engine Code and Content (including as modified by you under the License) that are not Examples.

f. Distribution of Non-C++ Programming Language Integration - You may Distribute an integration of a programming language other than C++ for the Licensed Technology, but if you do, the integration must be Distributed free of charge to all Engine Licensees, must be available in source code form (including, but not limited to, any compiler, linker, toolchain, and runtime), and must permit Distribution free of charge, on all platforms, in any Product.

You are permitted to post snippets of Engine Code, up to 30 lines of code in length, online in public forums for the sole purpose of discussing the content of the snippet, or distribute such snippets in connection with supporting patches and plug-ins for the Licensed Technology, so long as it is not for the purpose of enabling non-Engine Licensees to use or modify any Engine Code, or to aggregate, recombine, or reconstruct any larger portion of the Engine Code.

You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology in Source Code format. You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology in object code format, or any Content, except to grant end users the ability to use, or to permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute, a Product that you Distribute as permitted in Section 1(a) above. This paragraph does not limit your rights to Distribute and sublicense Examples.

When you generate revenue from a Product or Distribute it to end users, you must provide Epic with advance notification at unrealengine.com/release, as early as reasonably possible, including the name of the Product, the format of distribution, unique Product id (where applicable), and the distribution channel(s).

(B) Other Restrictions

(i) UE-Only Content

For UE-Only Content, you may exercise your rights under the License only if and to the extent that the UE-Only Content is utilized in a Product that requires the Engine Code to operate or is a non-interactive linear media product (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons, movies, or images) rendered using the Engine Code. However, if you hold a license to Twinmotion under the Twinmotion EULA, you may also exercise your rights under the License to import UE-Only Content into your Twinmotion projects for the purpose of visualizing such UE-Only Content within Twinmotion and exporting images and videos as permitted under the Twinmotion EULA. The UE-Only Content is subject to all of the terms of this Agreement that apply to Content, as well as the additional limitations described in this paragraph. All references in this paragraph to UE-Only Content include modified versions thereof made by you under the License.
(ii) Non-Compatible Licenses

You may not combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Licensed Technology with any code or other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the Licensed Technology be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement (“Non-Compatible License”). Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are prohibited: GNU General Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are allowed: BSD License, MIT License, Microsoft Public License, or Apache License. You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology under a Non-Compatible License.

(iii) General Restrictions

You may not engage in any activity with respect to the Licensed Technology, including as incorporated into a Product, (1) in violation of any applicable law or regulation; (2) in which the Licensed Technology is rented or leased; (3) that misappropriates any of Epic’s other products or services; (4) in support of a claim by you or any third party that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent. You also may not sell or grant a security interest in the Licensed Technology.

(C) Limited License for Unreal Tournament Content

Epic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license, during the Unreal Tournament Project, for a single User to use, reproduce, and modify the Unreal Tournament Content for the sole purposes of creating Unreal Tournament Contributions for the Unreal Tournament Project and creating Unreal Tournament UGC (the “Unreal Tournament License”). You may not Distribute or sublicense to any person other than Epic, or include in any product, any Unreal Tournament Content. The Unreal Tournament License does not grant you any title, ownership rights, or other intellectual property rights in any Unreal Tournament Content. You agree to retain and reproduce in all copies of the Unreal Tournament Content the copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Epic as they appear in the Unreal Tournament Content. Upon the completion of the Unreal Tournament Project or termination of the Epic Licenses under Section 17, or upon earlier written notice from Epic if you materially breach the terms of the Unreal Tournament License, you must destroy all copies of the Unreal Tournament Content. All references in this paragraph to the Unreal Tournament Content include modified versions thereof made by you under the Unreal Tournament License.

Any Distribution of Unreal Tournament UGC must take place through the Marketplace, Epic’s GitHub UnrealEngine Network, or other Epic services, unless such Distribution is solely for the purpose of legitimate development of such Unreal Tournament UGC, and then only to Engine Licensees, or legitimate testing of such Unreal Tournament UGC, and then only to Engine Licensees or individuals who have accepted the latest Unreal Tournament EULA.

(D) Limited License for Robo Recall Mod Support

Epic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license, during the period in which Epic makes access to the Robo Recall Content available to you, for a single User to use, reproduce, and modify the Robo Recall Content for the sole purpose of creating Robo Recall Mods for use with the Robo Recall video game (the “Robo Recall Mod Support License”). The Robo Recall Mod Support License is conditioned on the following: (a) you may not Distribute or sublicense to any person, or include in any product, any Robo Recall Content, except you may Distribute your Robo Recall Mods, but only in the form of .robo files and only if you do not charge a fee; (b) you may not Distribute, operate, or contribute to the Distribution or operation of stand-alone versions of the Robo Recall video game (or any variation thereof); (c) other Users may use, reproduce, modify and Distribute your Robo Recall Mods in accordance with this Section 1(D); and (d) you agree that the Robo Recall Content shall be treated as Licensed Technology for the purposes of the following Sections: Section 1(B)(ii) (Non-Compatible Licenses), Section 1(B)(iii) (General Restrictions), Section 15 (Indemnity), Section 16 (Export Compliance), Section 17(C) (Termination for Patent Action), Section 17(D) (Effect of Termination), Section 20 (U.S. Government End Users), and Section 22 (Amendments to Agreement).

The Robo Recall Mod Support License does not grant you any title, ownership rights, or other intellectual property rights in any Robo Recall Content (excluding your Robo Recall Mods). You agree to retain and reproduce in all copies of the Robo Recall Content the copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers as they appear in the Robo Recall Content. Upon Epic ceasing to make access to the Robo Recall Content available or termination of the Robo Recall Mod Support License under Section 17, you must destroy all copies of the Robo Recall Content. All references in this paragraph to the Robo Recall Content include modified versions thereof made by you under the Robo Recall Mod Support License.

You are solely responsible for the Robo Recall Mods you make available, and you covenant that your Robo Recall Mods will not violate Oculus’ content policies applicable to developers.

2. User License

The Licensed Technology is licensed to you for use by a single User (other than Paid Plug-ins, which may also be used by your Paid Plug-in Users as described below). The User may store the Licensed Technology on any of the User’s computers, but the Licensed Technology cannot be shared with others (including any other employees or agents) except through a permitted Distribution as described above.

In order to access and download the Engine Code and Content, you must set up an Account. You may not share or allow others to use your Account. You are responsible for the security of your Account. For questions regarding your Account, please go to epicgames.com/help.

Under the License, the User may use the Licensed Technology for as long as you comply with this Agreement. If you are a legal entity, references to “you” in this agreement also apply to the User in all cases. You are responsible for the User’s compliance with this Agreement.

For Paid Plug-ins, in addition to use by a single User, each Paid Plug-in User with respect to whom you have paid the associated fee may store the Paid Plug-in on any of the Paid Plug-in User’s computers and may use the Paid Plug-in on your behalf under the License, but the Paid Plug-in cannot be otherwise shared with others except through a permitted Distribution as described above. You are responsible for each Paid Plug-in User’s compliance with this Agreement.

If you are an Academic Institution, your use is not limited to a single User for any Licensed Technology other than Paid Content. Instead, you may store that Licensed Technology on any of your computers, and you may allow all users of those computers to use that Licensed Technology under the License. However, those users are not authorized under your License to Distribute or sublicense the Licensed Technology (including as incorporated in a Product). For that, they must obtain a License of their own.

3. New Versions and Content

During the term of your License, you will be entitled to access future Versions of the Engine Code and new Content that Epic chooses to make available to you. Epic does not have any obligation to make new Versions of the Engine Code or new Content available. Nor does Epic have any obligation to continue to make available for access or download any or all Versions of the Engine Code or Content. However, any Versions of the Engine Code and Content that Epic has made available to you, and for which you have accepted any applicable amendment to this Agreement as described in Section 22, are considered part of the Licensed Technology and may be used under the License (as amended by that amendment).

4. Paid Content

Epic may make Paid Content available to you for a fee. Your License to Paid Content is subject to your payment of the associated fee. In addition, your Paid Plug-in Users’ use of any Paid Plug-in under the License is subject to your payment of the associated fee for each Paid Plug-in User for that Paid Plug-in. When you pay the fee to obtain Paid Content, you are purchasing from Epic the right to have your License include that Paid Content. Regardless of any references Epic may make outside this Agreement to purchasing or selling Paid Content, Paid Content is licensed, not sold, to you under the License.

When you provide payment information to Epic or its authorized processor, you represent that you are an authorized user of the payment card, PIN, key, account, or other payment method specified by you, and you authorize Epic to charge such payment method for the full amount of the transaction.

From time to time, Epic may display links to Third Party Licensor Content on the Marketplace. Epic does not license or provide Third Party Licensor Content to you under this Agreement. Any use of Third Party Licensor Content requires you to enter into a separate license agreement directly with the provider of the Third Party Licensor Content. The terms of your license agreement with the provider of the Third Party Licensor Content will govern all matters related to your use of Third Party Licensor Content rather than the terms of this Agreement.

5. Royalty

You agree to pay Epic a royalty equal to 5% of all worldwide gross revenue actually attributable to each Product, regardless of whether that revenue is received by you or any other person or legal entity, as follows:

a. Gross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a Product to end users through any and all media, including but not limited to digital and retail;
b. Gross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable content, microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or exchange of content created by end users for use with a Product, or redemption of virtual currency, either within a Product or made externally but which directly affect the operation of the Product;
c. Gross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is directly associated with Product access or in-Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered campaign, if an amount is established in an early tier solely for Product access, your royalty obligation will apply to that amount for each backer with the same access, but not on additional amounts in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);
d. Your revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;
e. Revenue from advance payments for a Product (from a publisher or otherwise);
f. Revenue received in connection with a Product’s inclusion in a streaming, subscription, or other game-delivery service (e.g., Apple Arcade, Microsoft GamePass, or any similar or successor services), including without limitation development funds and bonuses; and
g. Revenue in any other form actually attributable to a Product (unless excluded below).

However, no royalty is owed on the following forms of revenue:

1. The first $1,000,000 in lifetime gross revenue for each Product;
2. Gross revenue attributable to a Product from a calendar quarter during which the gross revenue for such Product is less than $10,000;
3. The first $5,000,000 in gross revenue for each Product from the Oculus Store;
4. Consulting fees or work-for-hire fees which are non-recoupable for services performed using the Licensed Technology (e.g., an architect-created walkthrough simulation or a contractor-developed in-house training simulator);
5. Revenue from an Unrestricted Product, including for clarity, revenue from a Product which solely relies on the Licensed Technology for production of non-interactive linear media (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons, or movies) and which is Distributed in a form that does not contain the Licensed Technology or, in order to deliver, rely on servers running the Licensed Technology;
6. Revenue from a Product which is only Distributed to Engine Licensees (such as through the Marketplace);
7. Revenue from ancillary products which are not software and which do not contain embedded information (such as QR codes) which affects the operation of the Product (e.g., comic books, soundtracks, apparel);
8. Financial winnings generated by awards for the Product;
9. Revenue from donations for a Product which are not tied to Product access or in-Product benefits;
10. Revenue from Location-Based Experiences, such as interactive amusement park rides, coin-op arcades, or VR experiences, which use the Licensed Technology; and
11. Revenue collected from an end-user buyer of in-game items or other in-game content for your Product which is sold by an end-user seller and which is actually paid to the end-user seller and is not retained by you or any other party.

The royalty is based on gross revenue from end users, regardless of whether you sell your Product to end users directly, self-publish via the App Store or any similar store, or work with a publisher. The following simplified example illustrates the application of the royalty to gross sales: if your Product earns $10 on the App Store, Apple may pay you $7 (having deducted 30% as a distribution fee), but your royalty to Epic would still be 5% of $10 (or $0.50).

Royalties that you pay on an advance payment of revenue for a Product that is recoupable by the payer, such as a publisher, may be credited against future royalty payments that you incur under this Agreement for that Product.

Royalties must be reported and paid on a per-Product basis. Royalty exemptions may not be aggregated across multiple Products.

Within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which a Product earns revenue outside of the above-listed royalty exclusions, you must pay to Epic the full amount of the royalty due for that quarter and send Epic a royalty report on a per Product basis. Detailed information on royalty reporting and payment can be found at unrealengine.com/release.

The royalty will be payable under this Agreement with respect to each Product for as long as any Engine Code or Content (including as modified by you under the License) incorporated in or used to make the Product are protected under copyright or other applicable intellectual property law.

6. Payments

Epic reserves the right to charge a 2% late fee, per calendar quarter (compounding), for any amounts unpaid after the required due date.

You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made by you under this Agreement (other than taxes that Epic is obligated to pay on its income, which are Epic’s responsibility). If you are required by a government agency to reduce your payment to Epic for any reason, you are required to provide sufficient documentation to Epic supporting the withholding. For questions about withholding taxes or taxes in general, please go to epicgames.com/help.

7. Records and Audits

You agree to keep accurate books and records related to your development, manufacture, Distribution, and sale of Products and related revenue. Epic may conduct reasonable audits of those books and records. Audits will be conducted during business hours on reasonable prior notice to you. Epic will bear the costs of audits unless the results show a shortfall in payments in excess of 5% during the period audited, in which case you will be responsible for the cost of the audit.

8. Support

Epic does not have any support obligations with respect to the Licensed Technology under this Agreement. Support resources may be obtained at unrealengine.com/faq.

9. Feedback and Contributions

If you provide Epic with any Feedback, Epic is free to use the Feedback however it chooses. If you make any Contribution available to Epic, you hereby assign to Epic all right, title, and interest (including all copyright, patent, and other intellectual property rights) in that Contribution for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. If any of those rights are not effectively assigned under applicable law, you hereby grant Epic a non-exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, make, use, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, modify and make derivative works based on, and otherwise exploit that Contribution for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. If any of those rights may not be assigned or licensed under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and agree not to assert all of those rights. However, you may continue to freely use any Feedback that you provide to Epic, and you may continue to use, in any manner consistent with the License, any Contribution (including Unreal Tournament Code Contributions) that you make available to Epic. For Unreal Tournament Content Contributions, you may continue to use those Contributions only in a manner consistent with the Unreal Tournament License.

You understand and agree that Epic is not required to make any use of any Feedback or Contribution that you provide. You agree that if Epic makes use of your Feedback or Contribution, Epic is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution.

You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback or Contribution that you provide to Epic to grant Epic and other affected parties the rights described above. This includes but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights.

10. Third Party Software

The Engine Code includes Third Party Software components. If Third Party Software has separate software license or attribution requirements, the license terms or other attribution requirements for Third Party Software components can be found in the installation directory for each engine version (under the /Engine/Source/ThirdParty/Licenses sub-folder). By entering into this Agreement and using Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of those licenses. In this case, the Third Party Software terms will govern your use of the Third Party Software, and if there is inconsistency, those terms will take precedence over the terms of the License for the Third Party Software. You agree that the owners of the Third Party Software are intended third party beneficiaries to this Agreement in relation to your uses of Third Party Software.

11. Ownership

Epic or its licensors own all title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in the Engine Code and Content. You own all rights in the Products you develop under the License, other than the Engine Code and Content, Third Party Software, and any Contributions. All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale, and all of those rights are limited by the terms of this Agreement. No license or other rights will be created hereunder by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. Any attempted sublicense under this Agreement that is not consistent with the terms of this Agreement will be null and void.

12. Proprietary Notices and Attribution

You agree to retain and reproduce in all copies of the Licensed Technology the copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Epic and third parties as they appear in the Engine Code and the Content.

You agree to place the following notices in the credits (replacing xxxx with the current year) for any Product, to the extent such product has credits:

“[Product name] uses the Unreal® Engine. Unreal® is a trademark or registered trademark of Epic Games, Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere”

“Unreal® Engine, Copyright 1998 – xxxx, Epic Games, Inc. All rights reserved.”

No other license or right in the Epic Trademarks is granted under this Agreement. All use of the Epic Trademarks will inure to the sole benefit of Epic. You agree not to engage in any activity that could tarnish, dilute, or affect the validity or enforceability of the Epic Trademarks or cause consumer confusion or diminish any goodwill relating to any Epic Trademarks. If you wish to make further use of the Epic Trademarks, please go to unrealengine.com/branding.

Epic may use your trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos used with any Product, as well as publicly released screen shots and video content from the Product, in connection with Epic’s marketing, advertisement, and promotion of the Unreal® Engine in any and all media without restriction.

13. Hardware and Usage Data

You acknowledge that, as a default setting, the Engine Code will collect and send to Epic anonymous hardware and usage data from end users of Products. This functionality is used by Epic to improve the Engine Code. You may modify the Engine Code under the License to turn off that functionality in your Product, or you may include in your Product the capability for your end users to turn off that functionality in the Product.

14. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

The Licensed Technology, the Marketplace, and all other materials and information provided by Epic (the “Epic Materials”) are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, “with all faults” and without warranty of any kind. Epic, its licensors, and its and their affiliates disclaim all warranties, conditions, common law duties, and representations (express, implied, oral, and written) with respect to the Epic Materials, including without limitation all express, implied, and statutory warranties and conditions of any kind, such as title, non-interference with your enjoyment, authority, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness or suitability for any purpose (whether or not Epic knows or has reason to know of that purpose), system integration, accuracy or completeness, results, reasonable care, workmanlike effort, lack of negligence, and lack of viruses, whether alleged to arise under law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Epic, its licensors, and its and their affiliates make no warranty that (1) any of the Epic Materials will operate properly, including as integrated in any Product, (2) that the Epic Materials will meet your requirements, (3) that the operation of the Epic Materials will be uninterrupted, bug free, or error free in any or all circumstances, (4) that any defects in the Epic Materials can or will be corrected, (5) that the Epic Materials are or will be in compliance with a platform manufacturer’s rules or requirements, or (6) that a platform manufacturer will approve any of your Products, or will not revoke approval of any Product for any or no reason. Any warranty against infringement that may be provided in Section 2-312 of the Uniform Commercial Code or in any other comparable statute is expressly disclaimed. Epic, its licensors, and its and their affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure operation of or access to the Epic Materials. This paragraph will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Epic, its licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Epic’s service providers, shall be liable in any way for loss or damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Epic Materials or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. In no event will Epic, its licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Epic’s service providers be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or any other damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Epic Materials, or the delay or inability to use or lack of functionality of the Epic Materials, even in the event of Epic’s or its affiliates’ fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if Epic or its affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in those states or jurisdictions, the foregoing limitations of liability shall apply only to the full extent permitted by law.

15. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, pay the defense costs of, and hold Epic, its licensors, its and their affiliates, and its and their employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors, and other representatives harmless from all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs, and expert witnesses’ fees) that arise from or in connection with (a) any claim that, if true, would constitute a breach by you of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any Distribution or sublicensing of the Licensed Technology in violation of this Agreement) or negligence by you, (b) any claim brought by any third party to whom you Distribute or sublicense the Licensed Technology in violation of this Agreement (including without limitation any claim that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent), (c) any claim that any Product or any other matter you created, or your exercise of the Epic Licenses, infringes any third party’s intellectual property rights or other proprietary or personal rights (except to the extent of any claim that your authorized use of unmodified Engine Code or Content originally provided to you by Epic under this Agreement infringes any United States patent, trademark or copyright), or (d) any federal, state, or foreign civil or criminal actions related to any Product. You agree to reimburse Epic on demand for any defense costs incurred by Epic and any payments made or loss suffered by Epic, whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any matter covered by this Section 15.

If you are prohibited by law from entering into the indemnification obligation above, then you assume, to the extent permitted by law, all liability for all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs and expert witnesses’ fees) that are the stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation above.

16. Export Compliance

You agree to comply with all applicable federal and foreign laws, regulations, and rules, and complete any required undertakings. You will obtain any necessary export license or other governmental approval prior to accessing, downloading, exporting, re-exporting, or releasing the Licensed Technology.

B. Termination by Epic. Epic may terminate the Agreement by providing written notice if you materially breach any provision of this Agreement and the breach is not curable or, if it is curable, you fail to cure the breach within thirty (30) days of notice of the breach from Epic. Without limiting the foregoing, your failure to make any payment due under this Agreement or breach of any restriction under the Epic Licenses constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.

C. Termination for Patent Action. The Agreement will terminate automatically as of the date you commence any claim that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent, or otherwise support any claim by a third party that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent.

D. Effect of Termination. Upon any termination, the Epic Licenses will automatically terminate, you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to you by the Epic Licenses, and you must destroy all copies of the Licensed Technology in your possession and cease distributing any Products developed under this Agreement (other than Unrestricted Products). Within 30 days of termination, unless otherwise agreed by Epic, you must destroy all Products in your inventory (other than Unrestricted Products).

Any action or proceeding brought to enforce the terms of this Agreement or to adjudicate any dispute must be brought in the Superior Court of Wake County, State of North Carolina or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts. You waive any claim of inconvenient forum and any right to a jury trial.

The Licensed Technology is being licensed to U.S. Government end users only as Commercial Items and with only those rights as are granted to other licensees (other than Academic Institutions) under this Agreement.

21. Independent Contractor

You and Epic are independent contractors and are not the legal representative, agent, joint venturer, partner, or employee of the other. Neither party has any right or authority to assume or create any obligations of any kind or to make any representation or warranty on behalf of the other party.

22. Amendments of this Agreement

Epic may issue an amended Agreement at any time in its discretion by providing notice to you or by providing you with digital access to the amended Agreement when you next log in to your Account, access the Marketplace, or download additional Content or new Versions. You are not required to accept the amended Agreement. However, in order to continue accessing your Account or the Marketplace or to download or use additional Content or new Versions, you must accept the amended Agreement. By logging in to your Account, using the Marketplace, or downloading or using additional Content or a new Version, you hereby agree to be bound by the amended Agreement then most recently issued by Epic. If you do not accept the amended Agreement, you may not log in to your Account, access the Marketplace, download or use additional Content, or download or use any new Version that is made available by Epic contemporaneously with or after the issuance of that amended Agreement (but this will not terminate your License for the Licensed Technology that you downloaded prior to the issuance of the amended Agreement). If you are a legal entity, acceptance of an amended Agreement by any of your Users will be binding on you.

23. Notices

Where this Agreement calls for notice from Epic, including written notice, Epic may provide notice to you at the email address that you provided when you registered for the License (or any updated email address you subsequently provide). Epic’s notices to you will be effective when they are sent to that email address.

24. No Assignment

You may not, without the prior written consent of Epic, assign, transfer, charge, or sub-contract all or any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement, and any attempt without that consent will be null and void. You also may not transfer your Account. Epic may at any time assign, transfer, charge, or sub-contract all or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement. For clarity, you are not prohibited by Epic from assigning or transferring your rights in your Product, other than the Engine Code, Content, and Contributions. Third Party Software assignment and transfer is governed by the terms of the applicable licenses.

Vendor may require that you accept the amended Agreement in order to continue using any affected Solution you have previously acquired. If you decline to accept the amended Agreement, Vendor may terminate your use of such affected Solution, in which case you may obtain a refund for the portion of the subscription fee you have paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Period by following the instructions found here.

Each Update will be deemed to form a part of the “Solution” for all purposes under this Agreement. Updates may include both additions to, and removal of, any particular features or functionality offered by a Solution or may replace it entirely, and Vendor will determine the content, features and functionality of the updated Solution in its sole discretion. Vendor is not required to offer you the option to decline or delay Updates but, in any event, you may need to download and permit installation or activation of all available Updates to obtain maximum benefit from the Solution. Vendor may stop providing support for a Solution until you have accepted and installed or activated all Updates.

VENDOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF ANY SOLUTION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, THAT ANY SOLUTION WILL WORK PROPERLY ON ANY GIVEN DEVICE OR WITH ANY PARTICULAR CONFIGURATION OF HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE, OR THAT ANY SOLUTION WILL PROVIDE COMPLETE PROTECTION FOR THE INTEGRITY OF SELECTED DATA, INFORMATION OR CONTENT STORED OR TRANSMITTED VIA THE INTERNET.

6.4. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL VENDOR OR ANY COMPANY THAT CONTROLS, IS CONTROLLED BY OR IS UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH VENDOR (COLLECTIVELY, THE “VENDOR GROUP”) OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, LICENSORS, REPRESENTATIVES, SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, WIRELESS CARRIERS OVER WHOSE NETWORK OR SYSTEMS ANY SOLUTION IS PROVIDED, OR ANY OTHER BUSINESS PARTNER OF ANY MEMBER OF THE VENDOR GROUP (COLLECTIVELY, THE “VENDOR PARTNERS”) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR:

7.1. The term “Data,” as used in this Agreement and the Privacy Policy, means: (a) the information you provide to Vendor, another member of the Vendor Group, or a Vendor Partner in the course of ordering Solutions, including your name, billing address (including postal code), email address, phone number, payment card or account number, payment card or account verification code, payment card commencement date and expiration date, the account password you select for your account with Vendor or another member of the Vendor Group, and other Billing Data as defined in Vendor’s Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”, which you can find here) (collectively, “Transaction Data”); (b) information Vendor, another member of the Vendor Group or a Vendor Partner collects in the course of processing and fulfilling your orders for Solutions, including information about the make, model, operating system and other identifying details of your Device, the name of your Internet service provider, your Internet Protocol (IP) address; and (c) information about your installation and use of Solutions ((b) and (c) collectively being referred to as “Service Data” in the Privacy Policy).

7.2. You authorize Vendor, another member of the Vendor Group or a Vendor Partner, to use your Data, for the purposes described in the Privacy Policy. You acknowledge that such use of your Data includes processing and fulfilling your orders for subscriptions, improving Solutions, and providing information to you about the Solutions to which you have subscribed and offering you other Solutions. You acknowledge that Vendor or another member of the Vendor Group may share your Data with Vendor Partners such as Vendor’s ecommerce platform providers and payment processors, suppliers providing support, services and Solutions to you on Vendor’s behalf, and suppliers providing Vendor or a member of the Vendor Group with purchase analytics and crash analytics in respect of Solutions. You also acknowledge that Vendor or a member of the Vendor Group may share Data that is anonymized and aggregated with third parties for trend analytics.

8. TERMINATION
8.1. This Agreement will immediately terminate upon your breach of any of your obligations in this Agreement (including any breach of your obligations in Sections 2, 5 or 10), which will result in forfeiture of any rights you may have to receive Updates or to obtain a refund for the portion of the subscription fee you have paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Period. Vendor reserves the right to any other remedies available under law in the event your breach of any of your obligations under this Agreement adversely affects any member of the Vendor Group or any Vendor Partner. The exclusions and limitations of liability of members of the Vendor Group and Vendor Partners contained in this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement.

8.2. Vendor, by notice to you, may immediately terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time with respect to any particular Solution or all Solutions and the entire and exclusive liability of each member of the Vendor Group and each Vendor Partner, and your sole and exclusive remedy, in respect of any such termination will be limited to a refund for the portion of the subscription fees you have paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Period. From the effective date of such termination you will no longer be entitled to use any affected Solution and Documentation.

8.3. If a Subscription Period is conditioned on you paying a fee or charge, and if Vendor has not received payment by the 15th day following the payment due date, you will be deemed to have surrendered your license to use the Solution, and the license will terminate immediately without further action by you or Vendor.

9. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS
All Solutions qualify as “commercial items,” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users acquire such Solutions and related Documentation with only those rights set forth in this Agreement that apply to non-governmental customers. Use of such Solutions and related Documentation constitutes agreement by the U.S. Government entity that the computer software and computer software documentation is commercial, and constitutes acceptance of the rights and restrictions set forth in this Agreement.

10. EXPORT CONTROLS
You must comply with all applicable U.S. and international laws governing export and re-export of the Solutions, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. Without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, you represent, warrant and undertake that: (i) you are not a member of any of the denied persons list, unverified list, entity list, specially designated nationals list, debarred list or any other lists published by the U.S. Government; and (ii) you will not use, export or re-export any Solution in, or to, territories, destinations, companies or individuals in violation of U.S. and E.U. embargoes or trade sanctions. You will indemnify, defend and hold each member of the Vendor Group harmless from and against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding, and all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses arising from your failure to comply with this Section 10.

11. BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
11.1. This Section 11 applies to any Dispute arising from or related to any Solution, subscription for any Solution or this Agreement, and involving you and Vendor. “Dispute,” for the purposes of this Section 11, means any dispute, action, or other controversy regardless of the particular cause of action(s) asserted (i.e., it encompasses, among any other potential cause of action or legal basis, claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation or fraud, indemnification, tort (including negligence and strict product liability), and violation of statute or regulation).

11.2. In the event of a Dispute, you must provide Vendor with a notice of Dispute, which is a written statement of your name, address and contact information, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested by you. You must send any notice of Dispute by email to Vendor at legal@avast.com (stating Subject: Section 11 Notice of Dispute Under EULA).

11.3. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU WILL NOT SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.

11.4. If you and Vendor do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and the substantive laws of the State of New York (without regard to choice of laws principles). Except as provided in Section 11.5 below, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in litigation as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right to judicial review under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.

11.5. The arbitration requirement of this Section 11 is subject to the following exceptions:

11.5.1. You may litigate any Dispute in small claims court, in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. If you initiate a claim in small claims court, you are responsible for all court costs and fees.

11.5.2. All Disputes concerning any alleged misappropriation of your or Vendor’s intellectual property will be resolved in court.

11.5.3. If you are a consumer and live in the European Union, Norway, Iceland or Lichtenstein, you may be entitled to address your Dispute through an internet platform for online dispute resolution established by the European Commission (the “ODR Platform”). The ODR Platform is intended to facilitate out-of-court resolutions relating to online purchases of goods and services between consumers and traders based in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. You will find the ODR Platform by following this link: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.

11.6. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in accordance with the AAA’s “Consumer Arbitration Rules” effective September 1, 2014, including the “Costs of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)” effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the “Consumer Procedures”) and will be subject to the following:

11.6.1. The Consumer Procedures provide for certain fees, specifically allocating some to the consumer (you) and others to the business (Vendor). If your claim is US$75,000 or less, Vendor will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer. Vendor does not agree to bear any other costs. If your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.

11.6.2. Except as provided in below, the AAA’s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties. However, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a final decision. This Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures. You will commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted by conference call. However, if the proceedings are conducted pursuant to the AAA Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator(s) will have the discretionary authority to require a face-to-face hearing upon the request of a party.

11.6.3. You and the Vendor agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties’ agreement to arbitrate Disputes. If the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and Vendor will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the AAA’s Consumer Procedures.

11.6.4. If one or more parts of this Section 11 are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of this Section 11 and all other provisions of this Agreement. If such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such court proceeding will be the courts sitting in the county of New York, New York, U.S. For purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, the New York, New York courts’ personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.

11.7. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Section 11, if you acquired a Solution for other than personal or household use, the arbitration proceedings, including the payment of costs, will be administered in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “Commercial Procedures”). The Commercial Procedures are appropriately applied to any Dispute between the parties, and you will not advocate otherwise in any proceeding. However, this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Commercial Procedures.

12. GENERAL
12.1. Notice. Vendor may at any time deliver any notice to you via electronic mail, pop-up window, dialog box or other means, even though in some cases you may not receive the notice unless and until you launch a Solution. Any such notice will be deemed delivered on the date Vendor first makes it available through a Solution, irrespective of when you actually receive it.

12.2. Questions About This Agreement.

12.3. Separate Agreements. If you acquired two or more Solutions, even in a single transaction, or you acquired subscriptions to any one Solution in multiple transactions, you may have accepted this End User License Agreement multiple times. Although the terms and conditions you accepted may be similar or identical, each time you accepted the terms and conditions of this End User License Agreement you entered into a different and separate agreement between you and the Vendor providing the applicable Solution.

12.4. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Vendor relating to your use of the Solutions and Documentation. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, statements, warranties and representations with respect to your installation and/or use of the Solutions or Documentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will diminish any rights you may have under existing consumer protection legislation or other applicable laws in your jurisdiction that may not be waived by contract. This Agreement, the Applicable Conditions and the Documentation, to the greatest extent reasonably practicable, will be construed to be consistent with each other, but in the event of a conflict they will govern in the following order of precedence: (i) the Applicable Conditions; (ii) this Agreement; and (iii) the Documentation.

12.5. Interpretation. The headings in this Agreement do not affect its interpretation. The use of any gender includes all genders. The singular includes the plural and vice-versa. Where a word or phrase is defined, its other grammatical forms have a corresponding meaning. The words “includes” and “including” will be construed as followed by the words “without limitation.” Any reference to “use” of any software, Solution or Update by you shall be deemed to include any installation of any such software, Solution or Update by you (unless the context otherwise requires). This Agreement was originally prepared in the English language. Although Vendor may provide one or more translated versions of this Agreement for your convenience, the English language version of this Agreement will be the governing version of this Agreement in the case of any conflict or discrepancy. In the event that an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, in any judicial proceeding or otherwise, the terms of this Agreement will be construed as having been drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

12.6. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable laws, it shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement but the remainder of this Agreement will remain valid and enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.

12.7. Impossibility. Vendor will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance, due in whole or in part, to utility failures (including power), failure of the internet, failure of telecommunications or information technology services, failure of telecommunications or information technology equipment, strikes or other labor disturbances (including without limitation a strike or other labor disturbance arising in respect of any members of the Vendor Group or any Vendor Partners), acts of war or terror, denial of service attacks or other information technology attacks or breaches affecting any member of the Vendor Group or any Vendor Partner, floods, sabotage, fire, other natural disasters or Acts of God, or any other cause beyond any member of Vendor Group or Vendor Partner’s reasonable control.

12.8. Waiver. The failure of either party to insist upon the strict performance of any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of future compliance with this Agreement, and the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement on the part of either party shall be effective for any purpose whatsoever unless such waiver is in writing and signed by such party. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party shall not be construed as a continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of other breaches of the same or of other provisions of this Agreement.

12.9. Assignment. You may not assign your rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Vendor. Vendor may assign this Agreement at any time in its sole discretion without any prior written consent by you.

12.10. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any person other than you, members of the Vendor Group and Vendor Partners, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. No person other than you, Vendor and members of the Vendor Group may bring a cause of action pursuant to this Agreement. Vendor will be entitled (but not obligated) to enforce any rights, remedies, limitations and exclusions of liability, and legal defenses of any member of Vendor Group or Vendor Partner under this Agreement, including any rights and remedies for any loss, damage or claim suffered or incurred by any member of Vendor Group or Vendor Partner: (i) arising from or in connection with any failure by you to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement; or (ii) you are required to indemnify under this Agreement. No such loss, damage or claim will be deemed excluded as indirect, consequential or incidental loss or damage under Section 6.4.1 as a result of such loss, damage or claim having been suffered or incurred by another member of Vendor Group or Vendor Partner rather than by Vendor.

12.11. Governing Law. The law governing this Agreement and any Dispute (as defined in Section 11) will be the substantive law of the State of New York, U.S., without regard to choice of laws principles. This Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.

12.12. Internet connection. Certain Solutions may require an active and stable connection to the Internet in order to function. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that you have at all times an active and stable Internet connection.

12.13. Product names. Vendor from time to time may change the name of a Solution, or change the name or logo applied to the Solution to the name or logo of another member of the Vendor Group or a Vendor Partner. These changes do not alter your subscription for any Solution, the Subscription Period or this Agreement, and do not give you any right to terminate your subscription for a Solution, the Subscription Period or this Agreement.

13. SPECIAL TERMS
The following special terms apply to certain Solutions. If these special terms conflict with the remainder of the Agreement, these special terms will govern and take precedence with respect to the applicable Solutions.

13.1. Third Party Software, Services and Other Products. Some Solutions offer you the opportunity to acquire software, services and other products supplied by third parties. You acknowledge that the applicable third party is solely responsible for its offerings and Vendor makes no representations or warranties concerning those offerings and accepts no liability with respect to them, and if you acquire or use any of these third party offerings, the offerings and your use of them will be governed by any license agreements, terms of use, privacy policies and/or other terms and conditions required by the third party.

13.6.3. For Solutions downloaded from the Amazon Appstore, Amazon may designate certain customer terms of use for the Amazon Appstore as “Default EULA Terms.” Those Default EULA Terms will apply to your use of Solutions you purchase through the Amazon Appstore. The Default EULA Terms will specify, among other things, that Vendor is the licensor of the Solution and Amazon is not a party to this Agreement. If there are any conflicts between the Default EULA Terms and this Agreement, then to the extent of such conflict the Default EULA Terms will govern and take precedence. Amazon does not have any responsibility or liability related to compliance or non-compliance by Vendor or you with the Default EULA Terms.

13.7. Technician Edition. This Section 13.7 applies to the extent you have purchased the Technician Edition of a Solution. You may permit the number of technicians specified by the Applicable Conditions to use the Solution to perform optimization services and repairs to Devices owned by you (if you purchased an enterprise subscription) or third parties (if you purchased a breakfix subscription). Each technician may install the Solution on only one Device at any given time, and must remove the Solution from the Device before returning control of the Device to the user.

13.8. Assurance Plan. This Section 13.8 applies to Assurance Plans.

13.8.1. “Assurance Plan” means a service under which Vendor’s technician (an “Associate”), in exchange for a separate subscription fee, will assist you to remove viruses or other Malicious Code that infects your protected Device during the Subscription Period. Assurance Plans are sold together with certain Vendor antivirus Solutions or other security Solutions (each, a “Security Solution”), and supplement the protections offered by the Security Solution.

13.8.2. If you request Vendor’s assistance under the Assurance Plan, and if you and your Device qualify for assistance under Section 13.8.3, Vendor will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist you to remove the viruses or other Malicious Code affecting your Device. You hereby acknowledge, accept and agree that Vendor’s efforts may not be enough to remove certain viruses or other Malicious Code from your Device, and that Vendor, in the course of providing service, may alter, delete or corrupt data on your Device, change Device settings, or otherwise interfere with the proper operation of your Device.

13.8.3. The Assurance Plan covers: (i) only the Device for which you purchased the related Security Solution, and may not be transferred to another Device; and (ii) only viruses and other Malicious Code infecting the Device during the Subscription Period, after you downloaded and installed the Security Solution on the Device, and while the Security Solution was running with up-to-date Malicious Code definitions. Vendor may terminate the Assurance Plan without notice if it determines in its sole business judgment that you have requested or received service under the Assurance Plan for a Device not covered by the Assurance Plan, transferred or attempted to transfer the Assurance Plan to another person or entity, or otherwise breached the terms of the Assurance Plan.

13.8.4. Vendor, in providing assistance under the Assurance Plan, may require remote access to your Device, and/or may require that you install Assistance Software, in which case you acknowledge and agree that that Section 13.10 applies. If you cannot or do not provide remote access to your Device and/or you cannot or do not download and install the Assistance Software on the Device or follow Vendor’s or Associate’s other instructions, or if Vendor determines your Device does not qualify for support under the Assurance Plan, Vendor will not provide service under the Assurance Plan. Vendor may (but is not required to) refer you to a service under which Vendor or its subcontractor, for a fee, will provide assistance.

13.9. Premium Technical Support. This Section 13.9 applies to Avast Total Care, AVG Premium Tech Support, AVG Go and other technical support services (each, “Premium Technical Support”) that Vendor sells separately from its software Solutions, and through which Vendor may help you install, configure or troubleshoot any of a variety of software products and/or equipment or systems, including a PC, Mac, tablet, mobile phone or any other personal computing device, wireless router, cable modem or other router, printer, digital camera, media player, Smart TV and DVD/Blu-Ray player.

13.9.1. The Associate, in providing Premium Technical Support, will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist you with the problems you are experiencing but, due to the variety and the complexity of technologies available on the market, the Associate may not be able to resolve your issues. This may include, for example, problems that arise as a result of software or hardware errors not yet resolved by the manufacturer, or problems related to the equipment configuration that makes it impossible or unreasonably difficult for the Associate to properly diagnose and solve the issue. As a result, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Vendor’s efforts may not be enough to solve the issues you identify, or that those issues will not be solved in a timely manner.

13.9.2. The Associate, in providing Premium Technical Support, may require remote access to your Device, and/or may require that you install Assistance Software, in which case you acknowledge and agree that that Section 13.10 applies. If you cannot or do not provide remote access to your Device and/or you cannot or do not download and install the Assistance Software on the Device or follow Vendor’s or Associate’s other instructions, or if Vendor determines your Device does not qualify for support under the Premium Technical Support subscription, Vendor will not provide Premium Technical Support.

13.10. Remote Access; Assistance Software

13.10.1. Remote Access. Vendor or an Associate, when providing services under the Assurance Plan, as part of Premium Technical Support or in connection with other services, may need to remotely connect to, and take control of, your equipment in order to resolve the issues that you are experiencing. In connection with this remote connection session:

(a) The Associate may need to run various scripts on your equipment, make changes to its configuration, install and uninstall software, and make other changes to the equipment and/or software settings of such equipment as may be necessary to address your issues. You understand that the Associate may, but is not obligated to, install and remove various proprietary or third party software tools where the Associate deems it necessary to assist you with the issues that you are experiencing. Elements of such software are protected by law, including copyright.

(b) You acknowledge and agree that, by authorizing the Associate to establish a remote connection session, you grant Vendor (and partners and contractors acting on Vendor’s behalf) full or limited access to your equipment, software and network (depending on your equipment, software and network configuration), and authorize Vendor to make such modifications as described above or as otherwise advised by the Associate during delivery of the Solution. You acknowledge and agree that the Associate, or you acting on the Associate’s direction may alter, delete or corrupt software or data on your equipment, change equipment, software or network settings, or otherwise interfere with the proper operation of your equipment, software or network.

(c) You acknowledge and agree that the Associate may have access to any information stored on your Device. Associates are trained not to access more information than necessary to resolve the issues for which you are requesting the Associate’s support. You must nevertheless remain in front of your Device screen to observe the actions of the Associate while he or she delivers the Solution on your Device. You will have the opportunity to end the live support session at any time by advising the Associate or disconnecting the remote connection session.

13.10.2. Assistance Software.

(a) Vendor or an Associate, as a condition to providing services under the Assurance Plan, Premium Technical Support or other services, may instruct you to download and install on the Device a software program (the “Assistance Software”) allowing the Associate to gain remote access to your Device, gather information about the Device and its operations, diagnose and repair the problem, and change Device settings. You may also need to follow other instructions given by the Vendor or an Associate.

(b) If you or an Associate installs Assistance Software on a Device, that Assistance Software:

(i) May require that you activate it on your Device. If you do not complete the activation process within the period of time requested by the Associate or as prompted by the Assistance Software, the Assistance Software may cease to function until the activation is complete.

(ii) May communicate with Vendor’s (or its partner’s or contractor’s) servers on a regular basis to: (i) ensure that you receive all the services and software you are eligible to as part of your Solution; (ii) enable you to promptly launch a chat session with an Associate as part of your Solution; or (iii) give you access to certain self-service tools as part of your Solution.

(iii) May by default constantly run on your Device and perform various background tasks that help maintain your Device in working condition. When running, it may collect various data regarding your Device, including its technical specifications, information regarding its operating system, downloaded and/or installed software, updates and upgrades, the availability and the status of your security software, backups and firewalls, various unique identifiers, system and software error messages, network connections status, connected peripherals and other connected devices, and similar such information and data. This information helps Vendor to prevent many common issues that you may be experiencing, and also to quickly identify problems for which you may be requesting Vendor’s support.

13.11. Avast Driver Updater

13.11.1. Avast Driver Updater is intended for use on a Device that is a single physical computer, and not a “virtual machine” in which a shared computing resource emulates the functions of several dedicated physical computers. Avast Driver Updater will not be as effective when used on a virtual machine rather than a physical computer.

13.11.2. Avast Driver Updater relies on manufacturer-provided data in device driver installation files, including release dates, to provide information displayed by the Solution in scan results. MEMBERS OF THE VENDOR GROUP AND VENDOR PARTNERS DO NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT ANY DEVICE DRIVER PROVIDED BY THE SOLUTION WILL BE THE LATEST, OR ANY PARTICULAR VERSION, OF SUCH DEVICE DRIVER NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DIFFERENT OR CONTRARY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SOLUTION.

(a) “Aggregated Data” means data: (i) anonymized, and not identifiable to any individual person or entity; (ii) combined with the data of other users of an Avast Secure Gateway, and/or additional data sources; and (iii) presented in a manner by which individual users of an Avast Secure Gateway may not be identified.

(b) “Avast Secure Gateway” means the Avast Secure Web Gateway or Avast Secure Internet Gateway;

(c) “DNS Transaction” means a recursive DNS query you send through your use of Avast Secure Web Gateway.

(d) “Seat” means a subscription for an individual that accesses the Internet in connection with an Avast Secure Gateway, as further described by Section 13.12.5. A Seat may only be transferred from one such individual to another such individual if the original individual is no longer permitted to access, and does not access, the Internet in connection with the Avast Secure Gateway.

(e) “Transaction” means an HTTP or HTTPS request sent to, or by, you through your use of the Avast Secure Internet Gateway.

13.12.2. You must not, from any Device protected by an Avast Secure Gateway: (i) send spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of any applicable laws; (ii) send infringing, obscene, threatening, libelous, or illegal material; (iii) access blocked services in violation of any applicable laws; or (iv) run automated queries to Internet URLs.

13.12.3. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) in order for Vendor to provide the Avast Secure Gateway, you must forward your Internet traffic to Vendor via valid forwarding mechanisms that allow for automatic fail-over (i.e. DNS, PAC, IPSEC, GRE tunnels or an appropriate Vendor Solution); (ii) you are responsible for supplying Vendor with any technical data and other information Vendor may reasonably request from time to time; (iii) Vendor Group and Vendor Partners may use the Malicious Code (as defined in Section 13.16.1(b)), spam, botnets, or other information derived from your use of an Avast Secure Gateway for the purposes of: (1) maintaining, improving and/or analyzing the Avast Secure Gateways; (2) complying with any legal or contractual requirements; or (3) making malicious or unwanted content anonymously available to Vendor Partners for the purpose of further developing and enhancing the Avast Secure Gateways; and (iv) Vendor Group and Vendor Partners may develop and commercialize benchmarks and measures based on Aggregated Data.

13.12.4. Vendor Group and Vendor Partners reserve the right to manage bandwidth or route traffic across the Internet in a commercially optimal way, provided such actions do not compromise Vendor’s obligations with respect to the Avast Secure Gateways. Vendor or a Vendor Partner (as applicable) may suspend your access to, or download of, the Avast Secure Gateways in the event your use of these Solutions represents an imminent threat to any network of Vendor Group or a Vendor Partner, or if required to comply with applicable laws. In such circumstances, Vendor or Vendor Partner (as applicable) will: (i) suspend the Avast Secure Gateways only to the extent reasonably necessary to prevent any harm to any network of Vendor Group or Vendor Partners (for example, blocking offending source IP addresses) and to comply with applicable laws; (ii) use its reasonable efforts to contact you promptly and give you the opportunity to promptly change the configuration of you server(s) accordingly and/or work with you to promptly resolve the issues causing the suspension of the Avast Secure Gateways; and (iii) reinstate any such suspended Avast Secure Gateways after all such issues are resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of Vendor or Vendor Partner (as applicable).

13.12.5. For the purposes of determining whether you have purchased sufficient Seats, every 2,000 Transactions per calendar day flowing through the Avast Secure Internet Gateway shall be considered an Avast Secure Internet Gateway “Seat,” and every 2,000 DNS Transactions per calendar day flowing through Avast Secure Web Gateway shall be considered an Avast Secure Web Gateway “Seat.” You acknowledge and agree that the number of Seats you are required to purchase for your use of: (i) Avast Secure Internet Gateway will be calculated by dividing the total number of Transactions flowing through Avast Secure Internet Gateway per calendar day, by 2,000; and (ii) Avast Secure Web Gateway will be calculated by dividing the total number of DNS Transactions flowing through Avast Secure Web Gateway per calendar day, by 2,000.

13.12.6.  Although Vendor may not charge you separately for bandwidth in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway, Vendor and the relevant Vendor Partner incur significant bandwidth costs in providing of the Avast Secure Gateway to you. Accordingly, a material increase in your bandwidth consumption in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway will significantly affect and disrupt the business operations of Vendor and the Vendor Partner. You acknowledge and agree that, in circumstances where your bandwidth consumption in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway materially exceeds the number of DNS Transactions, or DNS Transactions per Seat, specified by the Applicable Conditions, Vendor or the Vendor Partner may notify you, in which case you must negotiate in good faith with Vendor: (i) on a bandwidth reduction plan; and/or (ii) to increase the pricing for of the Avast Secure Gateway for the remainder of the Subscription Term. If you are unable to reach a mutually agreeable resolution with Vendor within thirty (30) days from the date of notification by Vendor or Vendor Partner (as applicable), then Vendor may on thirty (30) days’ notice, terminate the remaining portion of your Subscription Term for the Avast Secure Gateway and refund to you any portion of the subscription fees you have pre-paid for the unused portion of the Subscription Term.

13.12.7. You acknowledge and agree that Vendor Group and Vendor Partners may use, reproduce, store, modify, and display the information from your transaction logs (i.e. the metadata of all network traffic sent to, or received from, you through your use of an Avast Secure Gateway) (the “Transaction Logs”). Transaction Logs will be retained by Vendor Group or Vendor Partners for rolling 6 month periods during the Subscription Period. On termination or expiration of the Subscription Period, the Transaction Logs shall be deleted by Vendor Group and Vendor Partners pursuant to the standard retention cycle of Vendor Group and Vendor Partners, or earlier as you may request in writing.

13.13. Certain HMA Solutions

13.13.1. Virtual Private Network. Unless otherwise provided by the Applicable Conditions, your subscription to the HMA Virtual Private Network product (the “HMA VPN”) authorizes you to create no more than 5 simultaneous connections in respect of each HMA VPN subscription. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you exceed the number of simultaneous connections authorized for your HMA VPN subscription, Vendor may at any time without any prior notice to you, suspend or disable your access to, and/or use of, the HMA VPN. If you wish to increase the authorized number of simultaneous connections for your HMA VPN subscription, please contact us at sales@hidemyass.com.

13.13.2. Web Proxy. The HMA web proxy service (“Web Proxy”) is a free Solution that does not require you to register your details with Vendor. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for, and Vendor Group and Vendor Partners accept no liability to you or any third party for: (a) your access, viewing or use of, or the contents of (including any offensive or objectionable content), any third party website accessed or viewed while using Web Proxy; (b) your compliance with the terms of use applicable to any third party website you access, visit or use while using the Web Proxy; and (c) any claim, loss or damage arising from any content that you create, make available, transmit or display while using Web Proxy, including any claim, loss or damage suffered or incurred by Vendor Group or Vendor Partners.

13.14. Virtual Private Networks. Several countries prohibit or restrict the use of virtual private networks (“VPNs”), and some have instituted technological measures to prevent VPNs from working. As a result, Vendor’s VPN Solutions (including the HMA VPN) are subject to territorial restrictions that may change from time to time. You can find further information here.

13.15. Appliance. Vendor may provide you with a dongle or other appliance (the “Appliance”) as a part of your Solution, in which case the additional provisions set forth in this Section 13.15 will apply:

13.15.1. The limited warranty period established by Section 6.1 is extended for the Appliance to 1 year from the date of purchase (the “Appliance Warranty Period”).

13.15.2. You must notify Vendor promptly if the Appliance is or becomes defective. If you notify Vendor of the defect during the Appliance Warranty Period and Vendor is unable to remedy the defect remotely, Vendor at its option and expense within 5business days will either: (a) replace the Appliance with a new or refurbished unit of the Appliance, in which case the warranty established by Section 6.1 will apply for the remainder of the Appliance Warranty Period applicable to the original unit of the Appliance; or (b) terminate your subscription and refund any unearned subscription fees you have previously paid. If the Appliance fails following the end of the Appliance Warranty Period, or if it fails because of misuse, tampering, interference, abuse, casualty, loss or theft, Vendor may charge you its standard price for the replacement unit of the Appliance. Vendor in its sole discretion may replace the Appliance with a new or different appliance that will also be subject to this Agreement (including Section13.15).

13.16.4. By uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content on the MTIP, you grant members of the Vendor Group a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, upload, publish, transmit, store, display, distribute, make available to others, and otherwise use Your Content in connection with the operation or use of the MTIP or the promotion, advertising or marketing of the MTIP, in any and all media or distribution methods or modes of making the MTIP or Content available to others (now known or later developed). You agree that this license includes the right for members of the Vendor Group to make Your Content available to Vendor Partners who collaborate with members of the Vendor Group for the uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content through other media or distribution methods or modes of making the MTIP or Content available to others.

All life threatening and emergency events should be directed to the appropriate response services.

Unless explicitly promising a “guarantee,” Nest Labs does not guarantee or promise any specific level of energy savings or other monetary benefit from the use of the Products or Product Software or any feature of them. Actual energy savings and monetary benefits vary with factors beyond Nest Labs’ control or knowledge. From time to time, Nest Labs may use the Product Software to provide you with information that is unique to you and your energy usage and suggests an opportunity to save money on energy bills if you adopt suggestions or features of the Product or Product Software. We do this to highlight an opportunity based on our analysis and information about you and your household. You acknowledge that these promotions are not a guarantee of actual savings, and you agree not to seek monetary or other remedies from Nest Labs if your savings differ.

The Product Software provides you information (“Product Information”) regarding the Products in your home and their connection with other products and services. All Product Information is provided “as is” and “as available”. We cannot guarantee that it is correct or up to date. In cases where it is critical, accessing Product Information through the Product Software is not a substitute for direct access of the information in the home.

10. Confidentiality.

“Confidential Information” shall mean the Product Software and all other information disclosed to you that Nest Labs characterizes as confidential at the time of its disclosure either in writing or orally, except for information which you can demonstrate: (a) is previously rightfully known to you without restriction on disclosure; (b) is or becomes, from no act or failure to act on your part, generally known in the relevant industry or public domain; (c) is disclosed to you by a third party as a matter of right and without restriction on disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by you without access to the Confidential Information. You shall use your best efforts to preserve and protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information at all times, both during the term hereof and for a period of at least 3 years after termination of this EULA, provided, however, that any source code you receive shall be held in confidence in perpetuity. You shall not disclose, disseminate or otherwise publish or communicate Confidential Information to any person, firm, corporation or other third party without the prior written consent of Nest Labs. You shall not use any Confidential Information other than in the course of the activities permitted hereunder. You shall notify Nest Labs in writing immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this EULA, and will cooperate with Nest Labs in every reasonable way to regain possession of Confidential Information and prevent any further unauthorized use. If you are legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, then, prior to such disclosure, you will (i) immediately notify Nest Labs prior to such disclosure to allow Nest Labs an opportunity to contest the disclosure, (ii) assert the privileged and confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and (iii) cooperate fully with Nest Labs in protecting against any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of such disclosure and/or use of the Confidential Information. In the event such protection is not obtained, you shall disclose the Confidential Information only to the extent necessary to comply with the applicable legal requirements.

11. For U.S. Government End Users.

The Product Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (OCT 1995), and more specifically is “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (SEPT 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (JUNE 1995), the Product Software is provided to U.S. Government End Users only as a commercial end item and with only those rights as are granted to all other customers pursuant to the terms and conditions herein.

12. Export Compliance.

The Product Software and related technology are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree to strictly comply with all such laws and regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain authorization to export, re-export, or import the Product Software and related technology, as may be required. You will indemnify and hold Nest Labs harmless from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including attorney’s fees) arising from or relating to any breach by you of your obligations under this section.

13. Governing Law; Venue.

The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where California law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that this EULA, and any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief relating to this EULA, will be governed by the laws of California, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. Any action or proceeding relating to this EULA must be brought in a federal or state court located in Santa Clara County, California and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such claim or dispute, except that Nest Labs may seek injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property or Confidential Information.

14. Assignment.

Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this EULA are assignable by you, and any such attempted assignment shall be void and without effect.

15. Notices.

Any notice to you may be provided by email to the address that you registered with Nest Labs.

16. Severability.

If any provision of this EULA is unenforceable, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

17. Waiver.

All waivers by Nest Labs will be effective only if in writing. Any waiver or failure by Nest Labs to enforce any provision of this EULA on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.

18. General.

The Product Software is deemed irrevocably accepted upon your use of the Product Software or Product. Nest Labs will have no responsibility to provide maintenance or support services with respect to the Product Software. The parties are independent contractors.

You acknowledge that the Product Software contains valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of Nest Labs, that any actual or threatened breach of Section 2 (Restrictions) of this EULA will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to Nest Labs for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach.

The headings of Sections of this EULA are for convenience and are not to be used in interpreting this EULA.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, no amendment to this EULA will be valid unless it is in writing hand-signed by the parties.

2.5 Cloud Services. The Parties acknowledge and agree that as a convenience to Licensee, and in connection with the use of the Licensed Products, Licensee may, at Licensee's sole determination, activate a cloud storage functionality which will permit Licensor to save and store queries performed by Operators for future access by Operators.  The cloud storage functionality does not permit storage of query results.  Licensee hereby acknowledges that the use of Licensor's cloud services is not a part of the Licensed Product, but rather an optional convenience offered to Licensee, which Licensee must explicitly elect to have activated.  Licensee further acknowledges that the cloud storage is offered "AS IS" and Licensor hereby disclaims any warranties with respect to the cloud storage functionality.  Should Licensee elect to use the cloud storage, then Licensee agrees that it shall be solely responsible for the content stored thereon and access provided thereto from within Licensee's environment and by the Operators.  Licensee shall be liable for any unauthorized access to the Licensee's cloud storage account obtained through Licensee's environment, any breach thereof, or compromise of the login credentials or other method of access provided to any Operator.

 

2.6 Ownership. Licensor owns the media on which the Licensed Software is originally or subsequently recorded; provided, however, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee may store and use the Licensed Software in electronic form for use solely by Licensee and Licensee's Operators. As between Licensor and Licensee, Licensor retains all right, title and interests in and to the Licensed Software (both as recorded on the original media and on any subsequent media), and all computer recorded data related thereto, the Licensed Documentation, and any Copies in any form. This Agreement is a license to use, and not a contract of sale for, the Licensed Product. All Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Licensed Product are retained by Licensor or the licensor of Third Party Software, as the case may be. Licensee shall not use either the name of Licensor, the licensor of Third Party Software, or the name of the Licensed Product or Third Party Software licensed under this Agreement for any commercial purpose or in any advertising, promotional or public statement without the prior, written consent of Licensor or the licensor of Third Party Software, which consent shall be at the sole discretion of Licensor or the licensor of Third Party Software. Licensee also agrees that all techniques, algorithms, and processes contained in or on the Licensed Products or any modification or extraction thereof constitute Licensor trade secrets and shall constitute Licensor Confidential Information to be protected pursuant to Section 11 hereunder.  Licensee agrees not to remove, deface, or destroy any copyright, patent notice, trademark, service mark, other proprietary markings, or confidential legends placed on or within the Licensed Software, the Licensed Documentation, and any Copies thereof in any form.

Prior to disposing of any media reflecting or on which is stored or placed any Software, you will ensure any Software contained on the media has been securely erased or otherwise destroyed. You recognize and agree a remedy at law for damages will not be adequate to fully compensate JCI for the breach of Sections 1, 2, or 10. Therefore, JCI will be entitled to temporary injunctive relief against you without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting bond or other security. Injunctive relief will in no way limit any other remedies JCI may have as a result of breach by You of the foregoing Sections or any other provision of this Agreement.

You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to educate yourself on how to respond to an emergency and to respond according to the specifics of your situation.
3.4Temporary Suspension. The Interactive Functionality may be suspended temporarily without notice for security reasons, system failure, maintenance and repair or other circumstances. You agree that you will not be entitled to any refund, rebate or other compensation for such suspensions. JCI does not offer any specific uptime guarantee for the Interactive Functionality.

TERM: Subject to termination under Termination Clause below the license shall be perpetual.

GRANT OF LICENSE: Subject to the payment of the applicable license fees, and subject to your abidance by the terms and conditions of this agreement, NetSupport Ltd hereby grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use one copy of the specified version of the software which you have acquired.

USE: The software is licensed with volume use terms specified in the applicable order acknowledgement, product invoice, license certificate or product packaging. You may make, install and use as many additional copies of the software on the number of devices as the terms specify. You must have a reasonable mechanism in place to ensure that the number of devices on which the software has been installed does not exceed the number of licenses you have obtained.

SERVER USE: To the extent that the applicable order acknowledgement, product invoice, product packaging or license certificate sets forth, you may use the software on a device or on a Server within a multi-user or networked environment (“Server Use”). A separate license is required for each device or “seat” that may connect to the software at any time, regardless of whether such licensed devices or seats are connected to the software concurrently, or are actually using the software at any particular time. Your use of software or hardware that reduces the number of devices or seats that connect to and use the software directly or simultaneously (e.g., “multiplexing” or “pooling” software or hardware) does not reduce the number of licenses required.

NetSupport Ltd. shall not in any event be liable for loss of profits, data or information of any kind or for special, incidental, consequential, indirect, or other similar damages arising from any breach of these warranties or use of the software even if they have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some countries do not allow the limitation or exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. This warranty does not affect your statutory rights, and you may have other rights that vary from country to country. In any event NetSupport’s maximum liability shall not exceed the price paid by the end-user / licensee.

TERMINATION: You may terminate this licence and this Agreement at any time by destroying the program and its documentation, together with any copies in any form.

Subject to the terms of this EULA, you grant 55 Degrees a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to: (i) collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify and create derivative works of Your Data, in each case solely to the extent necessary to provide the applicable Hosted Service to you and (ii) for Hosted Services that enable you to share Your Data or interact with other people, to distribute and publicly perform and display Your Data as you (or your Authorized Users) direct or enable through the Hosted Service.

 

(f) 55 Degrees shall own all modifications and derivative works of the Products, whether made by 55 Degrees, You or any third-party, and any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations or other information provided by You or any other party relating to the Products. You shall not take (and shall not allow any third party to take) any action inconsistent with 55 Degrees’ ownership and interests as set forth above, or assist any third party in doing the same, and You will report to 55 Degrees promptly in writing an instance of suspected infringement of any intellectual property related to the Products and give 55 Degrees reasonable assistance in investigating and prosecuting the infringing acts.

 
12. Confidentiality
 

(a) You agree that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical, and financial information disclosed to you by 55 Degrees constitute the confidential property of 55 Degrees (“55 Degrees Confidential Information”). Any intellectual property, the underlying technology, and any performance information relating to the Products shall be deemed 55 Degrees Confidential Information without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, you will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any 55 Degrees Confidential Information. Your non-disclosure obligation shall not apply to information that you can document:

 

(i) was rightfully in your possession or known to you prior to receipt of the 55 Degrees Confidential Information;

(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of your own;

(iii) is rightfully obtained by you from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or

(iv) is independently developed by you or your employees who had no access to such information. You may also disclose 55 Degrees Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to 55 Degrees). You acknowledge that disclosure of 55 Degrees Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by you, 55 Degrees shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall not operate as a separate warranty with respect to the operation of any Products.

 

(b) 55 Degrees agrees that in the event that 55 Degrees has access to, either in oral or physical form, Licensee’s confidential or proprietary information, including but not limited to Your Data and information concerning Licensee’s business, products, customers, services, policyholders and/or claimants (“Licensee Confidential Information”), 55 Degrees shall

 

(i) use such Licensee Confidential Information solely for the purpose of this EULA; and

(ii) take reasonable precautions, no less than it would take to prevent the disclosure of its own similar 55 Degrees Confidential Information, to ensure that it does not disclose Licensee’s Confidential Information to any third party without first obtaining the other party’s prior written consent.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the above, 55 Degrees may disclose, and may permit its representatives to disclose, any Licensee Confidential Information

 

(i) to the extent it is required to do so by law or any order or request of any government agency; and

(ii) to 55 Degrees’ representatives to the extent required for the purposes of implementing the transactions contemplated by this EULA.

 

(d) For Licensee Confidential Information that does not constitute trade secrets under applicable law, these confidentiality obligations will expire three (3) years after the termination of the agreement between 55 Degrees and Licensee. The recipient of such Licensee Confidential Information will be responsible for any breach of this Section by its employees, representatives, and agents. Licensee Confidential Information will not include any information that

 

(i) was independently developed by a party without the use of or reference to any Licensee Confidential Information belonging to the other party;

(ii) was acquired by either party from a third party having the legal right to furnish same to the other party; or

(iii) was at the time in question (whether at disclosure or thereafter) generally known by or available to the public.

 
13. Publicity Rights
 

Licensee grants 55 Degrees the right to include the Licensee’s company name, logo, and/or likeness that you provide during registration, and any review that Licensee may provide (in full or in part) to 55 Degrees, within Product promotional material, and on 55 Degrees’ web site. The licensee can revoke this right at any time by submitting a written request via email to support@55degrees.se requesting to be excluded from future Product promotional material. Requests made after purchasing may take thirty (30) calendar days to process.

Postman reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice

You expressly understand and agree that Postman shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Postman has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from access to your Content via the API.

6. Ownership and Sharing of Content
You own all right and title in the Content that you upload into, or generate by Using, the Product. Therefore, You are solely responsible for any Content uploaded into or generated by Using the Product through your Account.

Postman provides you the ability to store all or part of Your Content on the Server*. This storage functionality is provided to you on an “as-is where-is basis” and Postman does not take any responsibility for the security of such Content.

7. Fees and Taxes
Your use of the Product is subject to your paying Postman the fees applicable to the Product plan selected and/or used by you. You acknowledge and agree that different Product plans provide access to different sets of features in the Product as well as differential levels of permitted usage for those features. The fees and features available for each Product plan are listed at postman.com/pricing (the “Pricing”).

You will pay all fees in United States Dollars per the payment terms on an Order or otherwise mentioned at the time of purchase. The amount of fees payable by you shall vary depending upon the number of Users and the period or “subscription term” for which you intend to Use the Product. In making payment, you acknowledge and agree that you are not relying on being able to use the Product beyond the term of this EULA or on any future product enhancements or upgrades. If you add Users during a subscription term, such subscriptions will be billed at the then-current rate listed in the Pricing for your Product plan, and shall be co-termed through the end of the applicable subscription term. If you make any purchases through a reseller, you owe payment to the reseller as agreed between you and the reseller, but you acknowledge that we may terminate your right to Use the Product if we do not receive our corresponding payment from the reseller.

Our fees are exclusive of all taxes that are payable in respect of the Product or its Use in the jurisdiction in which the payment is either made or received. To the extent that any taxes, duties or similar levy is payable by Postman, you must pay Postman the amount of such taxes, duties or similar levies in addition to any fees owed by you under this EULA. If you have obtained an exemption from the payment of such taxes or levies and you provide such information to Postman, Postman will take reasonable efforts to provide you with such invoicing documents as may enable you to seek a refund or credit for the amount of taxes so paid from any relevant revenue authority, if such a refund or credit is available.

Except as otherwise specified in an Order, all subscriptions will automatically renew for periods equal to your initial subscription term (and you will be charged at the then-current rates in the Pricing) unless you cancel auto-renewal of your subscription through your Account. If you cancel auto-renewal, your subscription will terminate at the end of then-current billing cycle, or immediately if you so choose, however you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination.

The Software Product may incorporate technology (which may be provided by SEL or third party service providers engaged by SEL (each a "Dynamic Advertising Provider")) which enables advertising to be uploaded into the Software Product on your PC, and changed while the Software Product is being played on-line.

None of the information collected for this purpose including the identification number can be used to identify you.

The technology employed by Dynamic Advertising Providers may be located outside your country of residence (including outside of the European Union).

Where a Software Product incorporates dynamic advertising technology, the technology which serves the provision of dynamic in-game advertising is integrated within the Software Product.

Except for the software programs referred to in paragraph 2 of this Supplemental EULA and which are distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licences therein stated, the Wrapper Software and your use of it shall be governed entirely by the provisions of paragraph 1 below, to the fullest extent permissible by the applicable open source terms and conditions that may apply. This EULA is intended to govern your use of the Wrapper Software and any updates or patches to it, which are provided to you or which you may download from any SEL website, or other source authorised by SEL, expressly for such purpose.

1. Grant of Limited Non-Exclusive Licence
For so long as you are in compliance with the provisions of this EULA, to the extent that it is entitled to SEL grants you the non-exclusive limited right and licence to:

(a) to install one (1) copy of the Software Product onto a single PC hard drive which is under your custody and control and which meets the specifications referred to in the manual for your own private and domestic use only;

(b) to transfer the Wrapper Software, only in conjunction with the Software Product, from one PC hard drive to another PROVIDED it is only used with the Software Product, and only on one (1) PC hard drive at any one time and any hard drive on which it is used is under your custody and control at the time of use;

(c) transfer the Wrapper Software, only in conjunction with the Software Product and the benefit of this EULA, to another person PROVIDED such person has agreed to accept the terms of this EULA (and any other relevant EULA) and that you contemporaneously transfer any permitted copies of the Wrapper Software and the Software Product you may have made to that person or destroy all copies of the Wrapper Software and the Software Product not transferred. If any transferee does not accept such terms, then this EULA shall automatically terminate. Upon such transfer, you undertake to delete this Wrapper Software and the Software Product from your hard drive and the licence granted to you under this EULA shall automatically and immediately terminate.

In all other respects, the Wrapper Software is provided and your use of it shall be subject to and shall be governed by all of the same terms and conditions of the EULA for the Software Product as if those terms and conditions were repeated in this Supplemental EULA with references to ‘Software Product’ replaced by references to ‘Wrapper Software’.

2. Plugin Licences
The Wrapper Software incorporates certain third party plug-ins, which are governed by the open source licenses and other provisions ascribed to them below. The application of these licenses is limited strictly only to the plugins to which they are stated expressly to apply:

1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including payment of applicable fees, you have a non-exclusive and nontransferable right to use: the Software or Hardware for non-commercial (e.g. not for resale or rental or the like) or evaluation purposes, and only for the permitted number of servers, network devices or workstations as designated in the applicable Statement of Work (SOW), Work Order or Purchase Order (hereinafter “Order”) and for the term designated in the applicable Order between Netsurion and Customer or between Customer and authorized Netsurion partners. All Orders shall incorporate this agreement by reference. In connection with the License, Netsurion also grants to Customer the right to use, print, and copy the accompanying on-line read-me and help files regarding the use and customization of the Software or Hardware as reasonably necessary to make use of the Software or Hardware in accordance with the License. The Software is designed for use on-line in conjunction with your web browser and internet access. You are allowed only one account under this license, but you may access your Netsurion account on multiple computers.

2. Scope of Use and Acceptable Use Policy
Your license is conditioned on the proper use of the Software or Hardware. Any use of the Software or Hardware in violation of permitted uses is in breach of this Agreement and is unlicensed. For Software not embedded on Hardware, Customer’s use of the Software shall not exceed the permitted number of servers, network devices or workstations as designated in the applicable Order. Customer may move Software not supplied with Hardware at any time to different servers, network devices or workstations so long as Customer completely removes the Software from the former servers, network devices or workstations, and the total number of computers or devices does not at any time exceed the permitted number of servers, network devices or workstations. Customer may only use Software: (i) for so long as Customer has fully paid or remains current in the payment of applicable fees (if any, as in the case of an evaluation period); and (ii) for which Customer has received a license key (“License Key”). The Software is “in use” on a device when it is loaded into the temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into the permanent memory (e.g. hard drive, CD-ROM or other storage device) of that device, except that a copy installed on a network server for the sole purpose of distribution to other devices is not “in use.” You are responsible for all acts and omissions of the users of your account and all activities taken through the use of your account.

(a) Prohibited content, uses and activities include, without limitation, any use of its Products, Services or Content in a manner that, in Netsurion’s reasonable judgment, involves, facilitates, or attempts any of the following:

• violating any law;

• displaying, performing, sending, receiving or storing any content that is obscene, inappropriate, offensive, or otherwise objectionable, even if the material or its dissemination is lawful;

• harassing any person or advocating or encouraging violence of any kind against any person, entity or government;

• infringing, violating or misappropriating another's rights;

• obtaining unauthorized access to, or interfering by any means with, any user, system, network, service, or account, including evasion of filters or violation of the security or integrity of any network or system;

• distributing computer viruses or malware of any kind; or

• sending, receiving or supporting email messages that are unsolicited, deceptive, anonymous, excessively voluminous or that contain falsified identifying information, including spamming and phishing.

(b) You have no right to: (i) allow any unauthorized person to access or use the Software, Hardware or Services through your account; (ii) reverse engineer or attempt to discover any code or trade secrets related to any part of the Software, Hardware or Services; (iii) modify or create derivative works based on any aspect of the Software, Hardware or Services, except by your use of the built-in splash page editor or other built-in tools that Netsurion may offer to you to customize the user interface components of the networks you create; (iv) use the Software, Hardware or Services in any way that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in any unauthorized manner the servers, networks, data or other of our properties or services of or those of any other person or entity; (v) access or use any part of the Software, Hardware or Services to develop a competitive service or product; or (vi) use the Software, Hardware or Services outside the scope of the intended rights granted in this Agreement (collectively “Unauthorized Activities”).

(c) You are responsible to ensure that use of the Netsurion Software, Hardware or Services is in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws where the Software or Service is uploaded, hosted, stored, accessed or used and to implement necessary restrictions to prohibit use by any individual (e.g. restrictions on access by minors) or in any jurisdiction, as required to comply with such laws. Similarly, Netsurion reserves the right to take all actions it deems appropriate to comply with applicable laws.

(d) Suspension of Service. You shall not violate Netsurion’s Acceptable Use Policy. You further agree that Netsurion may suspend or revoke your access to the Service upon notice (which may be made by email or telephone) if Netsurion reasonably concludes that you are using the Service to engage in illegal activity and/or your use of the Service is causing immediate, material and ongoing harm to others. In the event that Netsurion suspends your access to the Service, Netsurion will use commercially reasonable efforts to limit the suspension to the offending portion of the Service and work with you to resolve the issues requiring the suspension of Service. You agree that Netsurion shall not be liable to you, nor to any third-party, for any suspension of the Service under this Section. Netsurion reserves the right to delete any offending content, at any time. Netsurion will notify you of any suspension or revocation action.

3. Evaluation License
In the event you obtained a trial or evaluation version of the Software, Hardware or Services, you will be awarded a license for the length of time as designated in the applicable order (“Trial Period”). You may use the Software, Hardware or Services for internal noncommercial purposes, solely to evaluate the suitability of the Software, Hardware or Services for your needs. Upon the expiration of the Trial Period, you must either purchase a license, or immediately cease using and/or accessing the Software, Hardware or Services, and, if applicable, permanently delete the Software or return the Hardware. If you do not complete a purchase prior to the expiration of the Trial Period provisions of this Agreement, all rights and licenses shall terminate pursuant to Section 14.

4. Consent to Use Data
You agree that Netsurion may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals.

5. Audit Rights
Customer will maintain accurate records of its use of Software during the term of this Agreement. Customer grants to Netsurion, or its independent accountants and auditors, the right to examine its books, records, networks, systems, devices, and accounts during Customer’s normal business hours to verify compliance with the License. In the event such audit discloses that the permitted number of servers, network devices or workstations is exceeded, or that Customer is otherwise in breach of this Agreement, Customer shall promptly pay to Netsurion the appropriate License fee for the additional devices, plus the cost of the audit if the underpayment totals more than five percent (5%) of the total License fee actually owed. At Netsurion’s option, Netsurion may immediately terminate this Agreement for failure to pay the required License fee and/or any other breach of this Agreement.

6. Third-Party Software/Open Source (“Open Source Software”)
Netsurion Software may incorporate and use third-party and open source software (“Open Source Software”). Customer acknowledges that use of such Open Source Software is required for effective use of the Software and such use shall be governed by third-party’s license agreement. Netsurion is not responsible for any third-party’s software and shall have no liability for Customer’s use of such third-party software. Nothing in this Agreement limits Customer’s rights under, or grants Customer’s rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable Customer license for the Open Source Software. However, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of damages provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in this distribution. If required by any license for Open Source Software, Netsurion makes such Open Source Software, and Netsurion’s modifications to that Open Source Software, available by written request at the notice address specified below.

Customer agrees not to disclose, provide or otherwise make available such Confidential Information, including, but not limited to, trade secrets, intellectual property, proprietary rights, or copyrighted material in any form to any third-party without the prior written consent of Netsurion. Customer agrees to implement reasonable security measures to protect such Confidential Information. Customer also may not release the results of any performance or functional evaluation of any program of the Software, Hardware or Services to any third-party without prior written approval of Netsurion for each such release. Customer may not use Netsurion’s name or other trademarks or refer to Netsurion or Netsurion’s products or services directly or indirectly in any papers, articles, advertisements, promotions, sales presentations, news releases or releases to any third-party without the prior written approval of Netsurion for each such use.

13. Amendments
Netsurion reserves the right to change the terms of service under this EULA from time to time at its sole discretion.

Notice of any Dispute with the Company regarding online use of the Licensed Works must be sent via email to dispute@gearboxsoftware.com as well as by U.S. Mail to Gearbox Software, LLC, ATTN: LEGAL DEPT/ARBITRATION NOTICE, 5757 Main Street, Suite 500, Frisco, TX 75034, and must contain a written statement setting forth (1) your name, address, and contact information; (2) your email address; (3) all facts giving rise to the Dispute; and (4) the relief you seek. Notice of a Company Dispute with you will be sent to your registered email address and by U.S. Mail to the known mailing address.

(d) BINDING ARBITRATION. IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT IF YOU AND THE COMPANY DO NOT RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY INFORMAL NEGOTIATION UNDER PARAGRAPH (b) ABOVE, ANY EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES IN PARAGRAPH (g) BELOW. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY OPTING TO USE THE LICENSED WORKS OR THE SITE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION WHICH FORFEITS ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. INSTEAD, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, WHOSE AWARD (DECISION) WILL BE BINDING AND FINAL, EXCEPT FOR A LIMITED RIGHT OF APPEAL UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. ANY COURT WITH JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTIES MAY ENFORCE THE ARBITRATOR’S AWARD.

THE ONLY DISPUTES NOT COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT TO NEGOTIATE INFORMALLY AND ARBITRATE ARE DISPUTES ENFORCING, PROTECTING, OR CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF ANY OF THE COMPANY’S (OR ANY OF YOUR OR THE COMPANY’S LICENSORS’) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

(e) Small Claims Option. Notwithstanding Paragraph (d), you may also have the right to litigate any Dispute regarding your use of the Licensed Works or the Site in small claims court, subject to satisfying all requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the disputed amount at issue.

(f) CLASS ACTION WAIVER. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION, IN COURT, OR OTHERWISE, WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT NEITHER YOU NOR COMPANY WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, A COLLECTIVE ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY PROCEEDING IN WHICH YOU OR THE COMPANY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. YOU AND THE COMPANY FURTHER AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF YOU, THE COMPANY, AND ALL PARTIES TO ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO FASHION A PROCEEDING AS A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION OR TO AWARD RELIEF TO A GROUP OR CLASS OF USERS IN ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.

(g) Arbitration Procedure. Subject to the terms herein, the arbitration of any Dispute will be conducted by, and according to the rules and procedures of, the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). Information about the AAA, and how to commence arbitration before it, is available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA will govern the arbitration. If you are an individual consumer and use the Licensed Works for personal or household use, or if the value of the Dispute is $75,000 or less, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes of the AAA will also apply. If the AAA rules or procedures conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement will govern. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules and procedures. Where the value of a Dispute is $10,000 or less, any hearing will be via electronic communications unless the arbitrator finds good cause to instead hold an in-person hearing.

(h) Arbitration Location. You agree to commence arbitration only in Collin County, Texas. The Company agrees to commence arbitration only in your county of residence.

(i) Costs & Fees. In any arbitration you commence, the Company reserves its right to seek its expenses associated with the arbitration process. In a Dispute involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing and AAA administrative fees and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. You and the Company agree that fees and expenses are not counted in determining how much a Dispute involves.

(j) Enforceability. If the class action waiver (which includes a waiver of private attorney-general actions) in Paragraph (f) is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, whether by judicial, legislative, or other action, then this Section and its subsections will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts of the Dispute will be severed and proceed in a Texas court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. The definition of “Dispute” in Paragraph (a) will still apply to this Agreement.

(k) Rejection Rights. If the Company makes a material change to this Section (other than an administrative change or revision to the notice address in Paragraph (c)) while you are authorized to use the Licensed Works or the Site, you may seek to reject the change by sending the Company written notice (in English, please) within 30 days of the basis for rejection by email to privacy@gearboxsoftware.com and via U.S. Mail to the address contained in Paragraph (c). You agree that you will informally negotiate and arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the most recent version of this Section prior to the change you rejected and that Company reserves all lawful rights irrespective of such rejection.

(l) Severability. If any provision of this Section and its subsections, other than Paragraph (f) (i.e., class action waiver), is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated only to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

(m) Survival. The provisions of this Section will survive termination of this Agreement and the provision of the Online Services, Licensed Works and the Site.

SovLabs will, at its own expense and as its sole obligation and Your exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, either replace that Software or correct any reproducible error in that Software reported to SovLabs by You in writing during the Warranty Period. If SovLabs determines that it is unable to correct the error or replace the Software, SovLabs will refund to You the amount paid by You for that Software, in which case the License for that Software will terminate. SovLabs shall not be in breach of the foregoing warranty if a nonconformance is caused by a modification, update, add-on, integration, product, or service not provided by SovLabs.

7.2 Software Disclaimer of Warranty. OTHER THAN THE WARRANTY ABOVE, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SOVLABS AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES UNDER THIS EULA, AND DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NONINFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY STATUTE, OPERATION OF LAW, COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. SOVLABS AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT IT WILL BE FREE FROM DEFECTS OR THAT IT WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION.
8.1 Defense and Indemnification. Subject to the remainder of this Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification), SovLabs shall defend You against any third party claim that the Software infringes any patent, trademark or copyright of such third party, or misappropriates a trade secret (but only to the extent that the misappropriation is not a result of Your actions) under the laws of the United States (“Infringement Claim”) and indemnify You from the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against You to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in settlement. The foregoing obligations are applicable only if You:  (i) promptly notify SovLabs in writing of the Infringement Claim; (ii) allow SovLabs sole control over the defense for the claim and any settlement negotiations; and (iii) reasonably cooperate in response to SovLabs requests for assistance.  You may not settle or compromise any Infringement Claim without the prior written consent of SovLabs.

8.2 Remedies. If the alleged infringing Software become, or in SovLabs’ opinion be likely to become, the subject of an Infringement Claim, SovLabs will, at SovLabs’ option and expense, do one of the following:  (a) procure the rights necessary for You to make continued use of the affected Software; (b) replace or modify the affected Software to make it non-infringing; or (c) terminate the License to the affected Software and discontinue the related support services, and, upon Your certified deletion of the affected Software, refund: (i) the fees paid by You for the License to the affected Software, less straight-line depreciation over a three (3) year useful life beginning on the date such Software was delivered; and (ii) any pre-paid service fee attributable to related support services to be delivered after the date such service is stopped. Nothing in this Section 8.2 (Remedies) shall limit SovLabs’ obligation under Section 8.1 (Defense and Indemnification) to defend and indemnify You, provided that You replace the allegedly infringing Software upon SovLabs’ making alternate Software available to You and/or You discontinue using the allegedly infringing Software upon receiving SovLabs’ notice terminating the affected License.

8.3 Exclusions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SovLabs will have no obligation under this Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification) or otherwise with respect to any claim based on:  (a) a combination of Software with non-SovLabs products (other than non-SovLabs products that are listed on the Order and used in an unmodified form); (b) use for a purpose or in a manner for which the Software was not designed; (c) use of any older version of the Software when use of a newer SovLabs version would have avoided the infringement; (d) any modification to the Software made without SovLabs’ express written approval; (e) any claim that relates to open source software or freeware technology or any derivatives or other adaptations thereof that is not embedded by SovLabs into Software listed on SovLabs’ commercial price list; or (f) any Software provided on a no charge, beta or evaluation basis.  THIS SECTION 8 (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION) STATES YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND SOVLABS’ ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS OR ACTIONS.

Fees and expenses due from You under this Agreement may not be withheld or offset by You against other amounts for any reason.

9.4 Late Fees.

BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  SOVLABS’ AND ITS LICENSORS’ LIABILITY UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE LICENSE FEES YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR $5000.

Recipient will protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as Recipient protects its own confidential or proprietary information of a similar nature but with no less than reasonable care.

You agree that you will provide all information truthfully and accurately, so that we have correct details about you and your Account. You will maintain and update this information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.

5.1.3. When creating an Account you will also be required to provide a ‘user name’ and/or ‘persona’ to represent you in connection with the Resources. User names and personas are tied to your Account and are non-transferable (meaning they cannot be transferred to anyone else). You may not use a user name or persona that is used by someone else, is vulgar or offensive, imitates any third party, infringes on any proprietary right of any third party, or otherwise breaches this EULA or the Rules. If you have questions about Account registration, please contact us at https://na.wargaming.net/support/ or, for Gods & Glory, support_en@godsandglory.com.

5.1.8. However, you are strongly advised to set up a standard Account in accordance with the above provisions. If a “demo account” is used, we are not responsible for keeping your progress in the Game, ensuring availability of game items and Additional Features, or maintaining the safety of any monetary or valuable assets in the Account. Cases when an Account and all connected assets may be lost entirely include the loss of the technical device, loss of password or any unauthorized modification of the operating system (“jailbreaking”) or of the software.

5.2 No Account Sharing

5.2.2 You are fully responsible for the conduct and actions using your Account and for all breaches of this EULA committed using your Account.

5.2.3 Any sale, purchase, lease, rent, exchange, other commercial exploitation of Accounts is prohibited.

5.3 Security of Your Account

5.3.1 You must ensure that you secure your Account, computer, mobile phone or other device from third party access. Please notify us immediately at https://na.wargaming.net/support/ or, for Gods & Glory, support_en@godsandglory.com if you become aware of:

5.3.2 We may employ certain physical, electronic and managerial procedures designed to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal information. Although we use procedures reasonably designed to safeguard the security of your personal information, transmissions made on or through the Internet and personal information stored on our servers or the servers of third parties that we use are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure. In addition, submissions made by email are not protected by encryption and are vulnerable to disclosure to third parties, including due to interception during transmission.

5.4 Ownership of Your Account. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO YOUR ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF WARGAMING.

6.4.7 we may monitor use of the Resources for a wide variety of different purposes, including preventing cheating and hacking, reducing toxic player behavior and improving the Resources.

7. Charges and Billing

7.1 You do not have to pay any registration or subscription fees to create an Account. However, some of the Resources or parts thereof may require you to pay a fee. If you decide to purchase or to subscribe to any such Resources, you must ensure that:

7.1.1 you are 13 years of age or older;

7.1.2 you are the authorized Account holder for the Account from which you are subscribing to the Resources;

7.1.3 you are authorized to use the particular credit card or other accepted payment method;

7.1.4 all information that you submit at the time of purchase is true and accurate; and

7.1.5 you agree to pay all the fees that you incur, including all recurring subscription fees, unless and until you cancel your Account or any particular subscription to any of the Resources in accordance with this EULA.

7.2 Any applicable fees and other charges on your Account are payable in advance and are not refundable. We may, from time to time, without prior notice modify, amend, or supplement payment methods offered within the Resources. We will post those changes in the corresponding section of the relevant Resource(s).

7.3 The final price of the purchase and/or subscription may vary depending on the selected payment method. To see the final price, click the button for the selected payment method. Please check currency exchange fees and charges in case payment currency is different from the currency of the selected payment method.

7.4 Prices for the purchases of the Resources are published in the corresponding section of the relevant Resource(s). Wargaming reserves the right to change the price at any time by making a respective change on the Resource(s). By making a purchase you are considered to demonstrate consent with the price. Price changes for any subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Resources after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the service prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.

7.5 We do our best to describe our services, Resources and prices thereof as accurately as possible. However, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant that product specifications, pricing, or other content on the Resources is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications, Wargaming shall have the right to refuse or cancel any purchase or subscription in its sole discretion. If we charged your credit card or other account prior to our cancellation, we will issue a refund in the amount of the charge. If you have already used your purchase or subscription has already expired, Wargaming reserves the right to block access to your Account until you reimburse the full price of the corresponding Resource(s). If a subscription or service you purchased from Wargaming is not as described, your sole remedy is to cancel the purchase and receive a refund in the amount of the purchase price.

7.6 Please remember that your Account is personal to you and cannot be transferred or traded with any other user.

7.7 IF YOU ARE PLAYING OUR GAMES ON EXTERNAL PLATFORMS SUCH AS MICROSOFT XBOX, PLAYSTATION®4 COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM, APPLE IOS OR GOOGLE ANDROID, YOU MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH ALL THIRD PARTY TERMS SET BY THOSE THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS. THE CHARGING AND BILLING IN SUCH GAMES ARE SUBJECT TO RULES OF THE THOSE PLATFORMS. WARGAMING DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE FOR SUCH PLATFORMS’ ACTIONS.

When playing Games on PlayStation®4 computer entertainment system and using the in-game store, the following rules apply. Purchase and use of items are subject to the Network Terms of Service and User Agreement. This online service has been sublicensed to you by Sony Interactive Entertainment America.

7.8 If your issuing bank offers automatic account updater services (Visa Account Updater, Mastercard Automatic Billing Updater or similar), these services may automatically update your payment card details in our acquirers’ systems when they change without any action on your part. If you do not want to have your card details automatically updated, please contact your issuing bank.

8. Additional Features

8.1 Additional Features. The Resources may permit you to acquire and accumulate rights to certain additional virtual game content, features and functionalities (including rights to in-game assets and points) as made available by Wargaming (“Additional Features”) which you are granted a license to use pursuant to the terms of this EULA. Additional Features constitute a limited, non-transferable, revocable right to use features of the Resources when, as, and if allowed by Wargaming and solely as governed by and permitted under this EULA. Subject to this EULA, Additional Features may be exchanged for access to upgraded features, may be exchanged for other Additional Features, or used in connection with other features made available by Wargaming through the Resources. Additional Features are not real-world currency, have no monetary value, and cannot be used, exchanged, or redeemed except as provided in this EULA, and cannot be transferred, in any case. For avoidance of doubt, Additional Features are not redeemable or refundable for any sum of money or monetary value from Wargaming or any third party at any time; provided, however, if and to the extent that any Additional Features are determined by applicable law to constitute real world currency or property, then they are the property of Wargaming.

8.2 Acquiring Additional Features. You may accrue Additional Features in a variety of ways. Wargaming may distribute or provide access to Additional Features in exchange for taking certain actions (either directly within the Resources, or in connection with a third party service), for a fee, or without any fee or required action, in its sole discretion. Wargaming may charge fees for the right to exercise rights associated with Additional Features. You agree that you do not “own” the Additional Features and that Wargaming has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Additional Features in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and that Wargaming will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right. Wargaming allows you to accumulate and manage your Additional Features, and may use terms such as “buy” and “sell” to refer to the grant or transfer of rights to use the Resources. Use of terms such as “buy” or “sell” does not indicate any ownership right. The total amount of a purchase may be adjusted by adding a fee, if any, applicable to the payment method you selected and for mandatory tax payments, if any, required by law. If adjusted, the total amount of the purchase will be recalculated automatically and displayed before you confirm the purchase, provided, however, that such functionality is supported by a chosen payment method. If your payment is in a currency other than that of the purchase amount shown on the Site, the exchange rate applied will depend on the selected payment method.

8.3 Additional Terms and Conditions. Without limiting the foregoing, the following rules apply to Additional Features:

8.3.1 Additional Features may only be redeemed for other Additional Features where permitted in the Resources;

8.3.2 Once you have purchased Additional Features, those Additional Features are non-refundable and non-exchangeable (whether or not you use them);

8.3.3 Additional Features cannot be sold or transferred to anyone, but you may buy Additional Features for another user of a Game through the gift shop applicable to that Game;

8.3.4 Additional Features cannot be exchanged for cash or any goods or services (except other Additional Features as permitted in the Resources);

8.3.5 To acquire Additional Features, you need to follow the instructions provided in the Resources; this can include making a payment and providing personal and financial details (which you represent shall be complete and accurate).

8.3.6 The price payable for the Additional Features (including any value added tax or other applicable taxes of duties) will be as set out on our Sites or as part of the Resources (as applicable), but we reserve the right to change the price of Additional Features at any time at our discretion;

8.3.7 We do not make any promises about how or when Additional Features may be available and can update or change Additional Features at any time;

8.3.8 If you receive Additional Features or achievements free of charge, at a lower price or without performing the actions that are normally required for receipt (e.g., experience points without playing the Game) (i) due to a technical error (a bug), you must report this to Wargaming immediately; or (ii) due to hacking, fraud or other illegal actions, you must report this to Wargaming immediately and pay for such Additional Features to the extent already consumed. In each case, Wargaming may delete such Additional Features and achievement without any notice to you and, if you have already consumed the Additional Features, to block access to your Account until you reimburse the full price of the corresponding Additional Feature(s).

8.3.9 You may only acquire Additional Features from us (or from any person that we authorize for this purpose), or from another authorized user of a Game through the use of a feature included in the Game by Wargaming expressly for such purpose (such as a gift through the gift shop applicable to that Game), and you must not obtain Additional Features from any other person or in any other way or attempt to do so; and

8.3.10 We may limit or block a request to acquire Additional Features for any reason.

8.4 Non-Refundable Purchase. In the event you purchase Additional Features from Wargaming, we will transfer the Additional Features to you only once that payment has been processed, and you may start using Additional Features as soon as you have completed the purchase process. You therefore have no right to cancel any transaction to purchase Additional Features after completion of the purchase process and being entitled to download the Additional Features.

8.5 Restrictions. You agree and acknowledge that Wargaming may deny or place limitations or restrictions on any purchase, issue, or redemption of Additional Features, individually or with respect to general volume, at any time and for any reason. Wargaming may halt, suspend, discontinue, or reverse any Additional Features transaction (whether proposed, pending or past) in cases of actual or suspected fraud, violations of other laws or regulations, or deliberate disruptions to or interference with the Resources, or the service of any affiliated or related third party.

8.6 Gifts. The following rules apply in regard to the gifts made through the Premium Shop:

8.6.1 As of the latest ToS update, gifts are only available in World of Tanks, World of Warplanes and World of Warships. Please check for updates.

8.6.2 Please note that gifts can be made within the same game server region only, i.e., gifts from an account on the North America server cannot be made to players on the EU server.

8.6.3 Within 24 hours after a gift is sent, the recipient will receive a notification via email. To receive a gift, the recipient must go to the My Gifts page in the Premium Shop and accept the gift.

8.6.4 A recipient may accept or decline a gift. A recipient has 30 days to accept a gift. If it is not accepted within this period, the sender will automatically receive compensation to their account as in-game currency equal to the price of the gift as at the time of purchase.

8.6.5 Within 24 hours after a recipient accepts or declines a gift, the sender will receive a notification via email.

8.6.6 If a recipient of a gift already owns a vehicle included in the gift, that vehicle’s full cost in gold as at the time of purchase in the Premium Shop will be automatically compensated to the recipient. The vehicle will not be transferred to the recipient’s account.

8.6.7 Any vehicles sent as a gift will be transferred together with a corresponding Garage Slot.

8.6.8 If the sender of a gift cancels the payment or fails to pay after the recipient accepts the gift, both accounts will be blocked until the circumstances are clarified. Please do not accept gifts from unknown senders.

11. Feedback and User Submissions

11.1 We are always pleased to hear from our users and welcome specific comments about our Resources. Unfortunately, however, our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those we have specifically requested. The aim of this policy is to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects that we develop might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other information such as game ideas or original artwork (“Submissions“).

11.2 Any and all Submissions that you send to us, whether at our specific request or notwithstanding our request that you do not do so, shall be deemed, and shall remain, our property from the time of uploading or transmission.

11.3 Accordingly, you hereby assign to Wargaming (including as a present assignment of future rights) all intellectual property rights in Submissions that you send to us to the extent owned by you. If for any reason this assignment is not effective, then you agree that Wargaming shall have a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, combine with other materials, publish, distribute, create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense (including, without limitation, to third party media channels, platforms, and distributors), publicly perform, publicly display, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, or grant third parties the right to do any of the foregoing, all or any portion of your Submissions, for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same. You further irrevocably grant us the right, but not the obligation, to use your name in connection with your Submissions. You also agree to waive any right of approval for our use of the rights granted herein and agree to waive any moral rights that you may have in any Submissions, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, you also waive any moral rights or rights of a like nature that you may have in such Submissions.

11.4 You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this section. Our receipt of your Submissions is not an admission of their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair our right to existing or future intellectual property rights relating to your Submissions. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to grant us the rights granted in this section.

For example, this might include a very serious contravention of this EULA, the Rules or the Privacy Policy, rules of third party platforms or where you have contravened the abovementioned rules or any of them on numerous occasions.

13.4 We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue any or all of the Resources at any time (including, without limitation, by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Resources) without notice to you. We will have no liability whatsoever on account of any change to the Resources or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Resources.

14. Interruptions to the Resources

14.1 From time to time we may need to update, reset, temporarily interrupt or shut down some or all of the Resources. Any of these actions may cause you to lose access to the Resources temporarily and/or cause you setbacks within a Game or other aspects of your use of the Resources. Please bear in mind that these activities are sometimes required to enable us to continue to provide the Resources.

14.2 We shall have no liability to you if the Resources or any aspect of them (including any Additional Features, accounts, statistics, user ranks or profile information) are interrupted or unavailable for any reason. We may suspend or terminate the availability of the Resources and Content, in whole or in part, to any individual user or all users, for any reason, at Wargaming’s sole discretion, and without any advance notice or liability.

15. Links to Third Party Sites

The Resources may include content from and hyperlinks to web sites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties including advertisers and other content providers (“Third Party Services”). We may also integrate third party technologies into our Resources and host our content on Third Party Services. Those Third Party Services may collect data or solicit personal information from you. We do not own, control or operate such Third Party Services, and are not responsible for their information, content, privacy policies, or for the collection, use or disclosure of any information those Third Party Services may collect. If you choose to access, transact with, or otherwise interact with any such Third Party Services, you do so at your own risk. For more information on Third Party Services, see our Privacy Policy.

16. Technical Requirements

17.1 From time to time, we may need to:

17.1.2 remove or suspend access to particular features, content or other parts of the Resources.

17.2 We need to take the actions referred to in this section automatically in order to keep the Resources running efficiently. It is therefore not practicable to ask for your approval or even to notify you before we take these actions and you confirm that you consent to us taking these actions without your prior approval and without any prior notice.

18. Alpha and Beta Tests

18.1 We may give you the opportunity to alpha or beta test new games and features of the Resources. Your participation as an alpha/beta tester is subject to the following terms and conditions.

18.2 Unless expressly indicated otherwise, all alpha/beta tests are confidential. The alpha/beta games, including information about features and functionality to be offered as part of the games, are confidential. If you participate in an alpha/beta test, you must safeguard and prevent unauthorized access to, copying, disclosure, and unauthorized use of the alpha/beta games. You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to alpha/beta games to any other person. Your obligation to keep the alpha/beta games confidential will continue until we publicly distribute, or otherwise disclose to the public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you are testing.

18.3 If Wargaming notifies you that you have been selected as an alpha/beta tester for an applicable alpha/beta game, you are invited to play the alpha/beta game for the sole purpose of evaluating the alpha/beta game and identifying errors. Nothing in this EULA or the Sites shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the alpha/beta games. THE ALPHA/BETA GAMES ARE PROVIDED FOR TESTING ON AN “AS IS” BASIS AND WE MAKE NO WARRANTY TO YOU OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

18.4 When playing certain alpha/beta games, you may accumulate or have access to Additional Features or other features referred to as treasure, experience points, equipment, or other value or status indicators. We may reset this data when the relevant game completes this testing phase or at any time during the testing process. In this case, all player history and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.

18.5 By starting an alpha/beta game, you agree that:

18.5.1 playing alpha/beta Games is at your own risk and that you know that the games may include known or unknown bugs;

18.5.2 any value or status indicators that you achieve through game play may be erased at any time;

18.5.3 we have no obligation to make these Games available for play without charge for any period of time, nor to make them available at all;

18.5.4 these Games may be available only by subscription once the testing process is complete or at any time in the future;

18.5.5 this EULA applies to your use of the games during the testing phase; and

18.5.6 unless otherwise expressly indicated by Wargaming, you will keep all information about the alpha/beta games confidential and not disclose such information to any other person.

19. Epilepsy Warning

Certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns in everyday life. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain monitor images or playing certain video games. This may happen even if the person has no medical history of epilepsy or has never had any epileptic seizures. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, consult your doctor prior to playing.

22.1 EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH HEREIN, THE RESOURCES, GAMES, ANCILLARY SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE WARGAMING ENTITIES SPECIFICALLY (BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, RELATING TO THE RESOURCES AND ALL CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE RESOURCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (i) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (ii) ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF THE COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. THE WARGAMING ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE RESOURCES OR ANY PART THEREOF, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE RESOURCES, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED. SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

22.2 YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE RESOURCES AND USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIALS OR CONTENT THROUGH THE RESOURCES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESOURCES) OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE RESOURCES OR THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF ANY GAMES, MATERIALS OR CONTENT.

23. Limitation of Liability

23.1 IN NO EVENT WILL THE WARGAMING ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES OR COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR RESOURCES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE RESOURCES OR ANY GAMES, MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON OR THROUGH THE RESOURCES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND WHETHER OR NOT THE WARGAMING ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

23.3 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

23.4 EACH PROVISION OF THIS EULA THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS EULA BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS EULA. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 21 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

24. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This EULA and any dispute, claim or obligation (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Wargaming agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Alameda County, California, USA for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.

25. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

25.1 Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Wargaming in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Wargaming agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this EULA shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this EULA. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND WARGAMING ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

25.2 Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 25.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

25.3 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Wargaming will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules“) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA“), as modified by this EULA, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Wargaming.

25.4 Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice“). Wargaming’s address for Notice is: Wargaming Group Limited, 105, Agion Omologiton Avenue, Nicosia 1080, Cyprus. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand“). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Wargaming may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Wargaming shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Wargaming shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Wargaming in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.

25.5 Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, Wargaming will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Alameda County, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Wargaming for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

25.6 No Class Actions. YOU AND WARGAMING AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Wargaming agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

25.7 Modifications. In the event that Wargaming makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Wargaming’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Wargaming’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Wargaming shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.

25.8 Enforceability. If Subsection 25.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 25 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 25 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 25 shall govern any action arising out of or related to this EULA.

6. Limited Warranties; Exclusions. Device42 warrants to Licensee that for a period of thirty (30) days following delivery of the Software to Licensee that the Software will perform substantially in conformance with the Documentation. Device42 does not warrant that the Software will meet all of Licensee’s requirements or that the use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free. The foregoing warranty applies only to failures in operation of the Software that are reproducible in standalone form and does not apply to: (i) a failure by Licensee to operate the Software within the systems requirements provided for the Software or Licensee’s use of the Software in combination with other products not provided or expressly approved by Device42; (ii) Software that is modified or altered by Licensee or any third party that is not authorized, in writing, by Device42; (iii) Software that is operated in violation of this Agreement or other than in accordance with the Documentation; (iv) failures that are caused by other software or hardware products; or (v) Licensee’s failure or refusal to implement maintenance releases.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS SECTION, THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DEVICE42 BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE, IN THE AGGREGATE, FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT OF LICENSE FEES THAT LICENSEE HAS PAID TO DEVICE42 IN THE PRECEDING SIX (6) MONTHS OR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF DEVICE42 HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT LIMIT LIABILITY FOR BODILY INJURY OR DEATH AS A RESULT OF DEVLICE42’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT SUCH LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

8. IP Indemnity. Device42 shall defend Licensee against any third party claim that Licensee’s use of the Software in accordance with the terms of this Agreement infringes any U.S. copyright, trademark or patent, and Device42 will indemnify Licensee against damages awarded on any such claim, provided that Device42 is promptly notified of any such claim and given reasonable assistance (at Device42’s expense) with, and sole control over, the defense and all negotiations for a settlement or compromise. Failure to so notify Device42 shall not relieve Device42 of its obligation to indemnify Licensee except to the extent such failure to notify shall have materially impaired Device42’s ability to defend against the claim. Device42 will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing. In the event that Licensee’s use of the Software is determined to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights, Device42 will, at its option, and at no cost to Licensee, either (a) procure a license enabling Licensee to continue to use the Software, (b) replace the Software with substantially equivalent software, or (c) terminate this Agreement and refund a pro-rated portion of the fee paid by Licensee hereunder for the period following termination, which shall be paid upon return of the Software to Device42.

This Section sets forth Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy and Device42’s sole obligation with respect to claims of infringement.

9. Licensee’s Indemnity. Licensee is responsible for the consequences of its use of the Software. Licensee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Device42, and any of its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, suppliers, resellers or agents, from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs and other expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) based on any claim brought by a third party, arising from Licensee’s use or modification of the Software except to the extent Device42 is required to indemnify Licensee under Section 8, provided that Licensee is promptly notified of any and all such claims and given reasonable assistance (at Licensee’s expense) with, and sole control over, the defense and all negotiations for a settlement or compromise. Failure to so notify Licensee shall not relieve Licensee of its obligation to indemnify Device42 except to the extent such failure to notify shall have materially impaired Licensee’s ability to defend against the claim. Licensee will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing.

10. Confidentiality. Licensee will treat the Software as a trade secret and proprietary information belonging to Device42 that is being made available to Licensee in confidence.
